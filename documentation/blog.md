# Blog

This document explains how to publish a blog post.

## Create a blog post file

## Draft the blog post

Blog posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

We support:

- All the basic syntax (headings, links, lists, etc.)
- Footnotes
- Tables
- Table of content (put `[toc]` anywhere in your document to generate it)

Our Markdown parser and stylings are very customizable. Ask the tech lead if there's a Markdown feature or styling change you'd like.

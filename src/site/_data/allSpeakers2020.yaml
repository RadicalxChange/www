    Charlotte Cavaillé is an Assistant Professor at The Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. In her research, Charlotte seeks to further our understanding of democratic politics’ effect on mitigating or enhancing market-driven economic inequality. More specifically, she focuses on the demand side of redistributive politics in post-industrial democracies, examining the dynamics of popular attitudes toward redistributive social polices at a time of rising inequality, fiscal stress and high immigration levels. In one of her more recent projects, she examines the relationship between immigration, the welfare state and the rise of populism. Through her work on policy preferences, she has become keenly aware of the ubiquity of "cheap talk" in surveys. In the context of a project titled “Who Cares? Measuring Attitude Strength in a Polarized Environment," she and her co-authors test a new survey tool, quadratic voting for survey research, that not only measures the level of support for a given policy package, but also seeks to capture the proportion of people who care intensely enough to translate their policy position into political action.

    vacui approach to her artistic practice, culling inspiration from networked
    communication, art and literary history, emerging technologies and
    speculative fiction.


    Gannis’s work has appeared in exhibitions, screenings and internet projects
    across the globe. Recent projects include “Portraits in Landscape,” Midnight
    Moment, Times Square Arts, NY and “Sunrise/Sunset,” Whitney Museum of

On her most recent full-length album PROTO, Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and A.I. voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is “shaping the future of A.I.,” and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her A.I. “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music.

    Elsa James (born in 1968, London, England) is an artist and activist living in Essex since 1999. Her work intervenes in the overlapping discourses of race, gender, diaspora and belonging. Her black British identity ignites her interdisciplinary and research-based practice, located within the fields of contemporary performance, text and language-based art, socio-political and socially engaged art; occasionally dabbling with drawing and painting. Solo works employ aural and the archives to examine ideas surrounding regionality of race and black subjectivity. Recent projects Forgotten Black Essex (2018) and Black Girl Essex (2019) explores the historical, temporal and spatial dimensions of what it means to be black in Essex; England's most misunderstood, and, homogeneously white county. Her social practice includes advocating for the inclusion of marginalised voices and communities in the arts sector; New Ways of Seeing, Making and Telling (2018), a visual provocation and live debate, challenged how the art sector can 'genuinely' address barriers to participation and involvement in the arts for Black, Asian and other minority communities.​

- name: Jeremy Helm
  title: "Proprioceive"
  picture: jeremy_helm.png
  bio: |
    A background of concern for existential risk has shaped half my life. My initial descent into this came from the implicit assessment that "this world just isn't going to work out" - after learning about the future of technological power and connecting that with an account of historic and present abuses of power.

    Being exposed to Nonviolent Communication (as formulated by Marshall Rosenberg) I got the reality that all conflicts happens at the level of strategy - meanwhile we human beings all have the same needs. Failing to make this distinction between our strategies & needs, we'll hang on to the strategy as if it were the need, and when these inevitable conflict with the strategies of others, they'll occur for us as enemies. My presentation has developed from the power of this insight.

    I live in Santa Cruz, CA, where I moved to work at a community based nonprofit to share the practice of Nonviolent Communication. I've contributed a chapter "Structured Listening: Technological design to help humanize humanity" to the book The Future of Text: A 2020 Vision.

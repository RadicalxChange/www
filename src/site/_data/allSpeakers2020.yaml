Her most notable work includes UX design for DARPA’S Big Dog, Principal Experience Designer on the HoloLens Project at Microsoft, HMI for Toyota’s AiCar, and Director of Design for Singularity University Labs. Today, as CEO of Superhuman-X, she is working to define the future of human-machine interface (HMI) through radical inclusion by leveraging brain-machine interface, sensors, robotics, AI, and AR/VR. She travels around the world speaking about the future of these technologies and their impact on humanity as faculty at Singularity University and for groups like WIRED, Google, and TEDx.

    Jody is also a practicing fine artist. She has an MFA from San Francisco Art Institute, teaches at Calfornia College of Arts, and has exhibited across the United States from New York City to Los Angeles with big pieces in tiny little galleries and a tiny piece in the Smithsonian.

  picture: "charlotte_cavaille.jpg"
  bio: |
    Charlotte Cavaillé is an Assistant Professor at The Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. In her research, Charlotte seeks to further our understanding of democratic politics’ effect on mitigating or enhancing market-driven economic inequality. More specifically, she focuses on the demand side of redistributive politics in post-industrial democracies, examining the dynamics of popular attitudes toward redistributive social polices at a time of rising inequality, fiscal stress and high immigration levels. In one of her more recent projects, she examines the relationship between immigration, the welfare state and the rise of populism. Through her work on policy preferences, she has become keenly aware of the ubiquity of "cheap talk" in surveys. In a set of working papers titled “Who Cares? Measuring Attitude Strength in a Polarized Environment," she and her co-authors test a new survey tool that not only measures the level of support for a given policy package, but also seeks to capture the proportion of people who care intensely enough to translate their policy position into political action.

    During her time at the CSDP, Charlotte plans to finish a book manuscript titled _Asking for More: Support for Redistribution in the Age of Inequality_. In _Asking for More_, she explores why, in countries where inequality has increased the most, such as Great Britain and the United States, voters are not asking for more income redistribution. The book starts by documenting the limits of workhorse economic models that focus on material self-interest. Charlotte then develops an alternative framework which advances the study of mass redistributive preferences in two ways. First, it incorporate fairness judgments into the dominant material self-interest tradition. Second, this framework highlight the key role of political elites’ competitive struggle for power. The main insight, succinctly put, is that the public’s response to inequality cannot be understood independently of changes in the supply side of politics: within the boundaries set by norms of fairness, what political elites have to say about inequality and redistribution matters as much as the public’s personal experiences with material hardship and inequality. If time allows, Charlotte will also work on a new project exploring the determinants of voters' perceptions of fairness in the realm of redistributive politics.

    Holly Herndon operates at the edges of electronic and avant-garde pop and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album PROTO, Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and A.I. voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is “shaping the future of A.I.,” and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her A.I. “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music.

    Mohammad Modarres is currently focused on making the growing need for faith-based, religious foods more accessible to individuals and organizations that want to foster more inclusive spaces (and dinner tables!). From Halal to Kosher, Mohammad uses his unique background—with past lives as the co-founder of a biotech company (that continues to operate in Northern California), an award-winning NYTimes published cartoonist, a board game designer, and TED Speaker—to produce products and programs that bring people together to celebrate their commonalities. Mohammad entered the food space by accident when he produced the first-ever "Interfaith Meat" products that are both (Zabihah) Halal and (Glatt) Kosher at the same time. Beyond following the most Orthodox laws of each faith to help all denominations eat from the same plate, Interfaith Meat helps food businesses save time, money, inventory space, and even food waste. Additionally, Mohammad works with local ranchers who use pasture-raised livestock to rebuild carbon soil (and use the best aspects of agriculture to tackle climate change). Mohammad offers "Interfaith Meat" through his latest venture called Abe's Eats (AbesEats.com). Outside of food, Mohammad works with the c-level executives of private and public companies across industries on branding, program and product development, and general strategy. As a public speaker, he has spoken at Columbia University, Food Lab, IFC Films, and TED, to name a few. Mohammad is a Johns Hopkins alumnus where he studied public health, was a Rhodes, Truman, and Schwarzman nominee before ultimately being awarded a George Mitchell National Scholarship to attend Trinity College Dublin on a full scholarship. In his spare time, he loves to produce the "Shabbat Salaam" interfaith dinner series and spends practically all his free time fixing his home – a 1979 VW Bus – which breaks down at the most conveniently inconvenient times.

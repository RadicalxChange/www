  slug: data-dignity
  description: |
    Technology companies wield highly concentrated power over the way peoples’ data is used, and make enormous profits from it. They can do this because we “bargain” for Big Tech services as if we were all isolated individuals, with “personal” datasets. In fact, the data we produce is always deeply social.  Sharing it affects our friends, families, and communities as much as it affects us.

    People should be able to exert democratic collective bargaining power over their data, in order to make joint decisions controlling its use, and negotiate appropriate compensation.

  slug: plural-voting
  description: |
    Plural Voting (also known as Quadratic Voting or QV) is a redesigned voting method reflecting the intensity of people's preferences in collective decisions. It greatly mitigates tyranny-of-the-majority and factional control problems.

    Voters receive budgets of “voice credits,” which they allocate to different questions on the ballot to signal the intensity of their conviction. Their voice credits convert to “counted votes” according to their square root. So if you put one voice credit on an issue, that is one vote; four credits are two votes; nine credits are three votes, and so on.

  slug: plural-funding
  description: |
    Plural Funding (also known as Quadratic Funding or QF) is a more democratic and scalable form of matching funding for public goods, i.e. any projects valuable to large groups of people and accessible to the general public.

    “Matching funding” is a model of funding public goods where a fund from governments or philanthropic institutions matches individual contributions to a project. Plural Funding optimizes matching funds by prioritizing projects based on the number of people who contributed. This way, funds meant to benefit the public go towards projects that _really benefit a broad public_, instead of things that only have a few wealthy backers. In Plural Funding, [total funding] for a proposal is [the square root of each contribution to it → summed up, then squared.] Plural Funding strongly encourages people to make contributions, no matter how small, and ensures a democratic allocation of funds meant to benefit the public.

  description: |
    Plural Property (also known as partial common ownership, COST, or SALSA) is a new way of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.

    In Plural Property systems, assets belong to no one and everyone. An asset’s current possessor must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend.  If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.

    A group of Web3 technologists has come together to form an independent RadicalxChange chapter focused on bringing Partial Common Ownership Tokens to Ethereum.  Learn more on our [website](https://partialcommonownership.com) or join the conversation in our active [Discord](https://discord.gg/CjxV954JMT).

        Geo Web is a set of open protocols for anchoring digital content (e.g., augmented reality, NFTs, apps, games, etc.) to physical locations. It uses plural property to administer its global digital land market with all proceeds being used to fund public goods. The network currently runs on Ethereum's Kovan testnet, but will launch on an Ethereum L2 rollup soon.

  slug: plural-money
  description: |
    Plural Money is a variation on an old idea. Community or “complementary” currencies are a huge and underexplored design space, promising grassroots economic empowerment. But we think that new technologies can make community currencies a much more powerful tool than they’ve ever been before.

    By (1) applying intersectional identity ideas, such as “soulbound” tokens, to creatively map communities, (2) using the currencies to purchase partial common ownership of shared assets (instead of traditional private property), and (3) setting smart transfer and exit taxes to hold value within communities, we think “plural money” promises an explosion of grassroots value creation.

  slug: social-identity
  description: |
    Whereas most existing identity concepts are either centralized (with a small number of large, institutional credential providers), or individualistic (with self-authentication), Social Identity solutions are aimed at expanding the scope of possible credential verifiers to include a wider variety of authenticators. To that end it can use non-transferable markers of affiliations, memberships, or credentials, such as [Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) — which are a bit like NFTs, except that they are not bought, sold, or traded; or [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential), a tamper-evident credential using cryptography to authenticate its authorship. In doing so, Social Identity better embodies human identities’ social, and multi-dimensional characteristics.

    Social Identity solutions are new and the possibilities are still emerging. But they are likely to become an important tool for establishing digital identity and defining community, unlocking important new governance structures. To name a few:

    - establishing the reliability of information sources in an era of deep fakes

    - permissioning access to communities’ shared assets, including data

    - making DAOs less plutocratic by anchoring governance power in community participation

    - [improving plural funding](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-soulbound-tokens-can-make-gitcoin-grants-more-pluralistic/10077?u=leone) by serving as a privacy-preserving, hard-to-fake evidence of group membership

    These are still early days for XIDs, and we are excited to help steer them in a productive direction.

- title: Data As Labour / Data Dignity (DAL/DD)

  description: |
    An identity system and a general purpose data structure for the
    decentralization of Internet. ISD protects from “surveillance capitalism”
    by diffusing the data in a range of communities.

    ISD aims to provide inalienable identity, verification of an attribute of a
    participant and partial identification, verification of a unique humanity
    of a participant, and authentication - while taking identity out of the
    hands of a few large multinational corporate platforms that have now become
    “identity providers” for billions of people.

    ISD provides inalienable identity by making use of three central primitives:

    1. Each participant has a digital journal listing all their identifying
    information. (Only that individual has access to the complete set of
    information in that store.)

    2. Each participant also stores, for each input X in their digital journal,
    the set of other participants who also store copies of X.

    3. Each participant stores a degree of credit which they are willing to
    offer every other participant as “social collateral” to give credence to
    identity statements.

  description: |
    Democracy, whether in a country, community or local club, is about giving
    each individual a say. But current voting methods miss a lot of what people
    really think. Quadratic Voting is a new twist on voting that allows
    individuals to express not just their choice, but also how strongly they
    feel about it. It can be applied to almost any situation where a group
    needs to make a decision or prioritize options. And in fact, in places like
    [Colorado]
    (https://www.wired.com/story/colorado-quadratic-voting-experiment/),
    it already is.

- title: Quadratic Financing (QF)
  image: "jennifer_lyn_morone.png"
  description: |
    Funding public goods, like shared infrastructure or open-source software, is
    a key challenge for democratic communities – among other things because of
    the natural incentive for individuals to “free ride” on the funding others
    provide. Matching funds, where individual donations are matched by those from
    government or a philanthropic institution, are a great way to address the
    problem. But traditional matching approaches based on centralized actors
    often don’t reflect the real needs of a community. Quadratic Finance solves
    this by prioritizing projects based on the number of individual donations,
    not their size. Like quadratic voting, the aim is to better capture true
    sentiment and turn it into action. Here too, experience is showing just how.

- title: COST / SALSA
  image: "jennifer_lyn_morone.png"
  description: |
    Private property is at the core of the capitalist system and has many
    advantages, not the least in incentivizing investment. But private ownership
    often puts owning before exchanging as well as profit before community. On
    the other hand, some socialists believe all property should be put to the
    most productive common purpose. But they struggle to identify what the most
    productive purpose is and to motivate people to pursue it. At RadicalxChange
    we think it’s possible to get the best of both approaches to property using a
    system called SALSA (Self-Assessed Licenses Sold via Auction). Under SALSA,
    everyone pays a tax on their property based on what they think it is worth –
    but must also agree to sell it to anyone willing to offer their self-assessed
    price. While it sounds radical at first, SALSA is a more coherent and
    sustainable way to govern the rights to possess finite resources. Its
    implications include a much more efficient use of resources, a better way of
    sharing common property, a fair wealth tax, and deeper economic equality.

- title: Radical Antitrust
  image: "jennifer_lyn_morone.png"
  description: |
    Most of us can agree that monopolies are not healthy for society. That’s
    why we have antitrust laws. But modern monopolies are often hidden, even
    from the monopolists themselves. Research has shown how large institutional
    investors in the US, who are the largest shareholders and hence owners of
    US corporations, often engage in harmful monopoly practices without
    realizing what they are doing. We think now is a good time for some radical
    new antitrust ideas: not to put a corset on markets, but rather to use
    market forces as a natural buffer against monopolistic distortions.

- title: Intersectional Social Data (ISD)
  image: "jennifer_lyn_morone.png"
  description: |
    In a highly digital world, data has a value not only in terms of
    information but also in terms of identity. Yet identity on the Internet is
    today largely in the hands of tech companies and others. This problem is
    well known and has spurred a lot of research in decentralized, or user-
    controlled, digital identity. At RadicalxChange we welcome this work, but
    also want to take it further. We believe the identity of individuals,
    whether in the real or virtual world, is made up of the intersection of a
    person’s social, business and other relationships. Such Intersectional
    Social Data could be the key to developing new knowledge and trust networks
    that don’t rely on governments or tech companies, but rather grow and
    evolve organically as we go through our lives.

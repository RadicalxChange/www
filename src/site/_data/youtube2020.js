    title: "Quadratic Funding in Ethereum",
    speakers: "Vitalik Buterin, Pia Mancini",
    description:
      "The Ethereum ecosystem has been an excellent initial testbed for quadratic funding, through the Gitcoin Grants project, which has directed over a million dollars of funding to Ethereum projects over five rounds in 2019 and 2020. It has effectively demonstrated the basic effectiveness of the quadratic funding mechanism; it has funded projects that are genuine public goods, and often projects that previous funding mechanisms missed. At the same time, the tests have shown some of the more subtle non-economic properties of the mechanism: how it affects people's feeling of being part of a community, how it helps the community learn more about itself, and how different variations affect these issues. In this presentation I go through what the Gitcoin Grants quadratic trials are, and what we've learned from the results of the last five rounds.\n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nVitalik Buterin\nFounder of Ethereum • RadicalxChange Board\nVitalik Buterin is the creator of the Ethereum Foundation.

      'The tools for governance in most online communities are inadequate to support basic processes used in offline groups, such as basic elections, term limits, and grievance processes. The Metagovernance Project (metagov.org) is a research group working to change this by building infrastructure to support online governance. This session will present Modular Politics, an ambitious computational governance framework intended to operate across diverse platforms, from social networks to multiplayer games.\n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nJoshua Tan is currently a doctoral student in computer science at Oxford studying under Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke; previously, he completed my master’s in pure math at the Courant Institute at NYU, where his research involved applications of geometry and topology to artificial intelligence. For his thesis, he’s been exploring different ways of applying category theory and sheaf theory to computational learning theory, from work on the sample compression conjecture to diversity measures in boosting. His interests include category theory, computational learning theory, sheaf theory, robotics, and art history.\n\nSeth Frey is data scientist and behavioral scientist who specializes in institutional approaches to self-governance and collective action online. He is an Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of California, Davis.

    description:
      "As the political polarization divides the US population, the once ideas of social progress turned again into securitarian attempts to protect the borders, the job market, the national identity, therefore reviving the White Supremacy mindset. The acceptance of violence, racism and social injustice nurtured the institutionalization of the fears depleting the State engagement to dignity. George Floyd's death crystallized the wrath of the minorities seeking for a systemic change with the unprecedented massive support of the majority.\n\nAs a Muslim clerical and human rights activist, Imam Dr Omar Suleiman will share his perspectives on the renewal of the new Civil Rights movements. In a discussion with the French activist Dr Maïmonatou Mar, he will talk about the need to tackle the democratic crisis through a two side strategy: radical and human of reformation (top down) and community empowerment (bottom up). \n\nFrom an updated narration of State racism, Imam Dr Omar Suleiman will point at the urgent need for institutional reforms to collectively break free from social injustice. If rooted in a racial American story of White Supremacy, his description of social injustice will echo with other types of nationalisms worldwide, all of them being threats to life of the most deprived. \n\nImam Dr Omar Suleiman will highlight as well the crucial importance of smart intersectional alliances to restore power and dignity of each and everyone through communities. He will illustrate it with his multiple experiences, including the Faith Forward Dallas at Thanks-Giving Square, a multi-faith coalition of clergy for peace and justice operating at the Border.  \n\n\nImam Dr. Omar Suleiman\nFounder and President • Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research\nImam Dr. Omar Suleiman is a world renowned scholar and theologically driven activist for human rights.

He frequently writes for CNN, USA Today, The Guardian, Huffpo, and The Dallas Morning News.His career started in his hometown of New Orleans where he served as the Imam of the Jefferson Muslim Association in New Orleans for 6 years and directed the \"Muslims for Humanity\" Hurricane Katrina Relief effort. It was in this time that he was noted on a national level as being a strong advocate of community service, interfaith dialogue, and social justice. Most recently, he was recognized by CNN as one of the 25 most influential Muslims in America and included amongst the Fredrick Douglass 200 most influential Americans whose modern day work embody the legacy of the great abolitionist.    \n\nDr. Maïmonatou Mar (Moderator)\nFounder • Gribouilli\nMaïmonatou Mar, phD, is the cofounder of Gribouilli, the French social venture empowering domestic workers.

      "Data Dignity is a realignment of the economics of the internet that will improve the outlook for people as algorithms and robots get better, while at the same time making those technologies work better. The basic idea is paying people more often for the value they create in the online world. Right now consumers typically barter their efforts and data online in exchange for services, but the advertising model which finances this arrangement has motivated poor quality results and has not been robust during an economic downturn. Instead, we propose to pay people in more situations, in order to expand the economy and make users aware, able, and motivated to make the online world better. Data Dignity is the ultimate win/win design for computation. \n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nJaron Lanier\nAmerican computer philosophy writer\nJaron Lanier coined the terms Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality – and had the first VR startup, manufacturing VR headsets and gloves for the first time, and creating the first surgical simulators, vehicle prototyping, and other apps – all in his youth back in the 1980s.  In the 1990s he was chief scientist for Internet2 (the academic consortium charged with making sure the internet would scale) and then of the first company to do AI processing of faces, such as changing identities or adding ornaments; that company went to Google, alas.  He’s also known as a constructive critic of technology.  He was concerned about how the internet was turning out from way back before it was popular to do that; has written a number of bestselling books on the topic.  Plenty of awards and accolades, including an IEEE Lifetime Achievement Award, the German Peace Prize for Books, one of the highest literary honors, and multiple honorary PhDs.  In 2018, Wired named Jaron one of the 25 most influential figures in tech from the previous 25 years.  Jaron’s also a musician specializing in unusual and obscure instruments; in the last year, he played with Sara Bareilles and T Bone Burnett on a #1 single, appeared on Colbert playing with Jon Batiste, and collaborated with Philip Glass.

      "Open banking and payment systems, Fintech, and Blockchain:  models, ideas, and challenges to come\n\nBrazil launched (from April to June 2020) a new set of regulations to open and bring more competition to the financial industry. This ambitious agenda, however, is subject to be gradually implemented and – in principle - will depend upon the creation of a technological system and a set of operational rules (named as “convention” by the regulation) between the incumbents, who have no incentives to truly collaborate to open the market for competition. The current banks, however and upon such a regulation, will choose the technological tools, basis, keys, and they are supposed to design the tech rules for the open (and to determine the level of openness to) such ecosystem. How to design an open platform and allow its implementation mitigating expected barriers to be raised by the current incumbents? How similar agendas played out in other countries?

    speakers: "Gradin, Mar, Orgad",
    description:
      "The Covid-19 has thrown into sharp relief just how vital the work of ‘key workers’ or ‘essential workers’ is for our lives and survival. Among those workers are domestic workers, who are disproportionately female migrants and women of colour. These workers, who have long been underpaid, overworked, and under-resourced, have suddenly become visible and seen as essential. What narratives about domestic workers have circulated during the Covid-19 pandemic, and what can we learn from them to maintain and foster the visibility, recognition and valuation of domestic workers after the pandemic? How can we change the narrative about domestic work, to support and value the 68 million workers worldwide? And how can new narratives about domestic work be mobilized to garner public and political support? The panel brings Dr Maïmonatou Mar (Gribouilli, France) and Shani Orgad, Professor of Media and Communications at the LSE to share their reflections on these questions and discuss the importance of changing the narrative about domestic work. \n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nCarlotta Gradin is the Vice President of Advocacy for UN Women France.  \nShe holds a Master in International Administration from the University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne and is also a graduate of Sciences Po Strasbourg.

      "When news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached Texas, months after its declaration, the U.S. activated re-constitution simultaneously along political, economic, and social dimensions. But achievement of social organization resting simultaneously on principles of freedom and equality would be long in coming, and the tempo of progress various along each of those three dimensions. Ultimately the social constitution of racial supremacy has been the hardest to displace and has woven its knotty, tenacious tentacles through political and economic dimensions as well. The time has come for a full liberation across all three domains and for justice by means of egalitarian participatory democracy, supported by truly free labor. This keynote will sketch out that vision of liberation and the relevance of RadicalXchange ideas to it.\n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nDanielle Allen is an American classicist and political scientist.

      "What does care look like when it evolves out of a consciously critical lens, and through a cultural practice? To find out, Marc Garrrett, co-director of Furtherfield (UK), chairs a panel with cultural producers: Cassie Thornton, Elsa James, and Tomislav Medak, to discuss care as an act of resistance: against despair, uncertainty, and social fracturing.\n\nThis conference is taking place at a time of mass social upheaval around the world. What knowledges and strategies do we need to acknowledge, and build on, in order to navigate through a world fractured by racism: class division, the covid-19 virus, imposed Austerity, international debt, as global communications infrastructures illegally and systematically hack and overwhelm democracy, Fake news generating tiny groups of clandestine media strategists working in alliance with dodgy politicians, corrupt financiers, and right-wing media giants? On top of this, we are also dealing with the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.\n\nWhat a mess we’re all in. However, this panel does not expect to answer all the problems and absolutes. It’s about accepting our imperfections and building on new and old, ‘lived’ choices, rather than conforming to the same hierarchies, behaviours and infrastructures which have caused the problems in the first place. The 21st Century needs better visions and more intuitive approaches of understanding each other, technology, creatures, and things. The so-called “strong men” have been the only ones with power to take decisive action and they have failed us. Now is the time to bring other voices in from the ground.\n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nTomislav Medak is a PhD researcher at Coventry University’s Centre for Postdigital Cultures.

Recent projects Forgotten Black Essex (2018) and Black Girl Essex (2019) explores the historical, temporal and spatial dimensions of what it means to be black in Essex; England's most misunderstood, and, homogeneously white county. Her social practice includes advocating for the inclusion of marginalised voices and communities in the arts sector; New Ways of Seeing, Making and Telling (2018), a visual provocation and live debate, challenged how the art sector can 'genuinely' address barriers to participation and involvement in the arts for Black, Asian and other minority communities.\nJames has exhibited, screened and presented projects nationally including Autograph (ABP), London; Big Screen Southend at Focal Point Gallery, Southend; Firstsite Gallery, Colchester; Furtherfield, London; Metal Culture, Southend; Site Gallery, Sheffield and Tate Exchange at Tate Modern, London.",

    description:
      "In the 1930s, many worried that the new medium of radio--with its ability to deliver the voices of autocrats to millions of listeners--had fueled the rise of fascism in Europe. Responding to this worry, US intellectuals during World War II sought to invent new media experiences that would inoculate audiences against fascism by encouraging the development of democratic and participatory values. These efforts were shockingly influential. They shaped everything from mid-century U.S. propaganda, to the aesthetics of the 1960s counterculture, to the ideas that structured the early internet. \n\nYet, the notion of democracy baked into these media experiences was deeply flawed. It failed to take account of key democratic values, including diversity.\n\nFred Turner's books and essays tell the story of how media and technology (and the ideologies baked into them) helped construct the present moment. They are indispensable to anyone interested in the politics of cyberculture, and of central importance to RadicalxChange. \n\nSpeakers\n------------------\n\nFred Turner is the Harry and Norman Chandler Professor of Communication at Stanford University.

    description:
      'Democracy has been a work in progress since classical antiquity.  Today, political life can at times feel like nothing more than raising one’s arm, before being entirely drowned out.  This is, in part, because the simple system of "one person, one vote" does not sufficiently capture the nuances of our preferences.\n\nInto the tradition of democratic progress enters a novel collective decision-making mechanism called Quadratic Voting (QV). With Quadratic Voting, voters can not only signal what they want, but also how much they want it. A simple system of tradeoffs ensures that strong preferences get recognized; while preventing the loudest voices from dominating the political landscape. One of the most interesting features of QV is that passionate minorities can outvote indifferent majorities - enabling greater compromise and more legitimacy. \n\nOver the past year, Quadratic Voting has been tried and tested in multiple arenas. Paula Berman, founding member of Democracy Earth Foundation, chairs a panel with instigators of democratic change using QV: Max Kuck, Ben Henderson, and Ruth Catlow and Sarah Friend to discuss the challenges and successes of their initiatives to democratize decision-making.\n\nSpeakers\n-----------------\n\nArtist, curator and researcher of emancipatory network cultures, practices and poetics.

They also were seen as critical to thinking about long-term risks and policies while voters and politicians focused on the short run.  But planning institutions rightly were criticized as top-down and bureaucratic.  This talk looks at the ambition of state planning institutions, with a focus on their role in Latin America.  It then shows how the response to COVID-19 exposed many flaws in the traditional notions of planning.  Finally it turns to the future: what does participatory planning look like?

      "It is always easier to say what you don’t want than saying what you do want. We have seen plenty of dystopian visions shared since the Industrial Revolution. While intended perhaps to serve as warnings, at times it seems these narratives have instead provided roadmaps hurling us further towards those visions. Storytelling needs drama, but does the drama in the stories we tell need to be all about warnings of potential injustices in the systems we create? Maybe fiction can help unlock our moral imaginations and help us reveal new perspectives to overcoming obstacles confronted in the real world. Earth2030 and The Scheme of Things are two projects that ask about the world we could have, or would prefer to have, as expressed through fiction. They have been running independent workshops leading up to the conference that have culminated in a number of stories and scenarios of desirable worlds. During the conference they are collaborating across two workshop sessions with the hopes of weaving together a broad range of imagined worlds that have been contributed by experts bringing specific knowledge of particular fields and technologies, with the imaginative and philosophical expressions of artists and world-builders. \n\nSPEAKERS\nPrimavera De Filippi is a permanent researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris, a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, and a Visiting Fellow at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute.

      "This workshop, a continuation of the recent “Building blocks of Web 3.0” workshop held at Harvard Law School, will discuss existing narratives coming from different standpoints or communities with regard to how the Internet could or should be governed. It will then move on to discuss whether, as the Internet is slowly embracing every aspect of our life—both online and offline— there is a need for a new narrative around which we should rally. To prepare for the workshop, we ask participants to read this article, which reviews existing narratives and introduces the problem.\n\nSPEAKERS\nPrimavera De Filippi is a permanent researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris, a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, and a Visiting Fellow at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute. She is a member of the Global Future Council on Blockchain Technologies at the World Economic Forum, and co-founder of the Internet Governance Forum’s dynamic coalitions on Blockchain Technology (COALA). Her fields of interest focus on legal challenges raised by decentralized technologies, with a particular focus on blockchain technologies. She is investigating the new opportunities for these technologies to enable new governance models and participatory decision-making through the concept of governance-by-design. Her book, “Blockchain and the Law,” was published in 2018 by Harvard University Press (co-authored with Aaron Wright).\n\nJuan Ortiz Freuler is a PhD candidate in Communication at the University of Southern California (USC), where he explores how political systems can be affected by the internet. Juan is also an Associate at JustLabs, and has held positions as a Fellow (2017-2018) and an Affiliate (2018-2020) at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. Before moving to the US, Juan developed and executed research projects at several non-profit organizations in Argentina and Mexico. A graduate from the Di Tella Law School in Buenos Aires, Juan has also obtained Masters degrees in both Public Policy and Social Science of the Internet at the University of Oxford.\n\nJoshua Tan is currently a doctoral student in computer science at Oxford studying under Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke; previously, he completed my master’s in pure math at the Courant Institute at NYU, where his research involved applications of geometry and topology to artificial intelligence. For his thesis, he’s been exploring different ways of applying category theory and sheaf theory to computational learning theory, from work on the sample compression conjecture to diversity measures in boosting. His interests include category theory, computational learning theory, sheaf theory, robotics, and art history.",

    title: "Rethinking Art Ownership: In Conversation With Serpentine & RxC",
    description: `March 21st, 17:30 GMT | 10:30 AM PDT

Art enriches society through the weaving of relations between the cultures that create it, and the cultures that receive it. Conventional ownership and private property rules undermine such interactions in the context of art understood as a public good, constraining liquidity and alienating artists from the very communities that should be their allies: collaborators, neighbourhoods, collectors and supporting institutions. We recently published a blog post that discussed some of the most explicit pinch points within the existing art economy and argued for the need to initiate a new chapter in rethinking art ownership by introducing it from the perspective of Partial Common Ownership.

Join RxC and Serpentine UK in a discussion with the authors of the post: Victoria Ivanova (Serpentine UK), Matt Prewitt (RxC), and Paula Berman (RxC | Host).`,

    title: "Good Enough Ancestor Release",
    bodyText: `Good Enough Ancestor tells the story of Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first Digital Minister and the world’s first transgender minister, and how she took Taiwan from an occupation of their national legislature to a beacon of digital democracy. 

Filmed over ten days in the lead up to Taiwan’s historic 2024 elections, the poetic documentary threads together Tang’s reflections on her own life—overcoming bullying, a life-threatening heart condition, and gender dysphoria—with the story of Taiwan’s evolution from martial law to its most recent election. Against the backdrop of rising authoritarianism and geopolitical tensions, Good Enough Ancestor is a timely reminder of the fragility of democracy and the responsibility to tend to it for future generations. 

Click the link below to watch the film and read a roundtable discussion between Audrey Tang, director Cynthia Wade, editor Sasha Friedlander, and cinematographer Boaz "Bo" Freund for *Combinations* Magazine.`,

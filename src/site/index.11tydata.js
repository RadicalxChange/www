    title: "Rethinking Art Ownership: In Conversation With Serpentine & RxC",
    description: `March 21st, 17:30 GMT | 10:30 AM PDT

Art enriches society through the weaving of relations between the cultures that create it, and the cultures that receive it. Conventional ownership and private property rules undermine such interactions in the context of art understood as a public good, constraining liquidity and alienating artists from the very communities that should be their allies: collaborators, neighbourhoods, collectors and supporting institutions. We recently published a blog post that discussed some of the most explicit pinch points within the existing art economy and argued for the need to initiate a new chapter in rethinking art ownership by introducing it from the perspective of Partial Common Ownership.

Join RxC and Serpentine UK in a discussion with the authors of the post: Victoria Ivanova (Serpentine UK), Matt Prewitt (RxC), and Paula Berman (RxC | Host).`,

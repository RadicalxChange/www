The Monopoly craze re-started among our community with a tweet from RadicalxChange French Chapter in November 2020 ([source](https://twitter.com/RadxChangeParis/status/1326475989770186752?s=20)), two years after the invention of COST Monopoly by RadicalxChange Foundation and 116 years after its first version.

_“En 1904 le Monopoly était anticapitaliste ! Avec [@RadxChange](https://twitter.com/RadxChange), il le redevient !”_

_“In 1904 Monopoly was anti-capitalist. With @RadxChange, it reverts to it.”_

## The History of Monopoly

From RadicalxChange French Chapter:

> “Everything started with Elizabeth Magie Phillips, scenographer, who wanted to expose increasing inequalities. She decided to create and patent the game The Landlord's Game, which will later be tweaked to become the symbol of capitalism, as explained in this documentary.”

Originally, "Lizzie" (like [@glenweyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl)) was inspired by the progressivist ideas of Henry Georges, who believed that “the land is a common good and that citizens should act collectively, as one landlord.”

Around the world, access to housing is the result of systemic inequalities. In France, many projects have emerged, such as [@qlay_io](https://twitter.com/qlay_io), first micro real estate platform open to all to become landlords, one square meter at a time.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The original Landlord&#39;s Game, of which the monopoly rules were only one rule set, was intended precisely to illustrate this point: <a href="https://t.co/rYV8LLmdfL">https://t.co/rYV8LLmdfL</a>. they were supposed to show how capitalism leads to zero sum dynamics and georgism fixes these.</p>&mdash; (((E.

## The COST Monopoly

In Radical Markets, [@glenweyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl) explores the role of the Harberger tax in housing access. Nothing better than COST monopoly to explain the role of the Harberger tax in access to housing. The COST monopoly was introduced to explain this concept via a game anybody could easily play.

> "To prevent monopolization, it’s necessary to shift from a model of private property to 'mankind’s property' — from individual ownership to the commons." - Nathan Chen

Read [Nathan Chen’s blog post](https://medium.com/@nathan.writes/exploring-partial-common-ownership-on-the-monopoly-board-59163ad73608) for more details on the concept and the game.

COST monopoly has been played around the world by the RxC community.

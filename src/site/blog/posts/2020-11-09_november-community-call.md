## Community Calls 2.0

We are trying new ways to make the community calls more engaging and participatory.

- New way to transparently participate to the agenda via [Typeform](https://community910829.typeform.com/to/OhB3aq5h)
- New tool to foster smaller discussions after the community call: [Airmeet](https://www.airmeet.com/event/c92098f0-0f27-11eb-b346-4dc4456ccc9d?mc_cid=68f168afd1&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D)
- To come: up/down voting topics via Slido, quadratic voting

Please send us your ideas to [community@radicalxchange.org](mailto:community@radicalxchange.org) to make it even better.

## RxC Community Updates

- **RxC chapter updates**
  - France (Mai): Research labs have been started with the 2022 French presidential elections in view to include RadicalxChange ideas
  - Brazil (Vicinius): research group has started with many people involved - see [tweet](https://twitter.com/rxcBrasil/status/1321986690685325313?s=20)
  - Barcelona (Nikoline): They are implementing in action the Sociocracy governance at the Akasha Hub Barcelona. Demonstrating models in catalunya, are getting pretty developed. They now launched “decentralized disobidience” Which is an interesting concept, that might be attractive to the “other” side.
- **RxC community updates**
  - **Ferran Reyes**: working on a governance toolkit, [https://vocdoni.io](https://vocdoni.io), as community manager, in Catalonia. Watch this [panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmwGnfKacnQ) on e-voting to learn more about vocdoni. He also leads and participates in several projects from the social economy such as the biggest common network (fiber optic) in the South of catalonia, following Elinor Ostrom principles, and a Food Cooperative in Barcelona. He’s also worked in the first crowdfunding platform to experiment with match funding pools (Goteo.org).
  - **Jacob Kelter**: He wrote the paper "Agent-based models of QV", agent-based models of QV and organizing deliberation around policing, which he presented recently at the Computational Social Sciences Society of the Americas annual conference. Contact him at [jacobkelter@u.northwestern.edu](mailto:jacobkelter@u.northwestern.edu) for a copy of the paper or more information.
  - **Graven Prest**: He is working on a project called the Geo Web, using Harberger taxes to administer a digital land market in an open-source AR metaverse. Check it out at [https://www.geoweb.network/](https://www.geoweb.network/)
  - **Sophie Pornschlegel (EPC)**: She works in a Brussels-based think tank on democracy, rule of law and institutional reforms. She heard about RadicalXchange at an OECD event and here she was.
  - **Auryn Macmillan**: He is working on clr.fund, running their first on-chain and (almost) permissionless quadratic funding round. For anyone that wants to take it for a spin, instructions are [here](https://blog.clr.fund/how-to-contribute-to-clr-funds-first-real-money-matching-round/).
  - **Kevin Owocki**: He shared some work done by Gitcoin around QV and QF:
    - A site to simply create your own QV elections with unique links for each voter: [https://quadraticvote.co/](https://quadraticvote.co/)
    - What the fuck is QF: an educational site meant to explain QF in simple terms: [https://wtfisqf.com/](https://wtfisqf.com/)
- **Some interesting links and food for thought shared during the meeting:**
  - **The work of Tom Atlee**
    - [http://taoofdemocracy.com/](http://taoofdemocracy.com/)
    - [http://co-intelligence.org/](http://co-intelligence.org/)
    - [https://www.wd-pl.com/](https://www.wd-pl.com/)
  - **Plurapolit.de**, an audio platform for deliberation between German / European politics
  - **Le Grand Jeu**: to get things going and gather ideas about a common goal and situation, they have made a digital version of the game. It’s a great way to get people into a different role and get ideas flowing. This works especially well when working with very different profiles and interests.

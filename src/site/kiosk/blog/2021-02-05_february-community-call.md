- **Amit Kumar: Open source Decentralised Mesh Networking**
  - Open source Decentralised Mesh Networking which can help people in protest sites with internet bans to communicate (p2p with some data, processing hubs) with each other, so that everyone can send/receive encrypted messages, consensually use each other’s cameras, microphones and speakers to rally their voices (occupy protests digital mic-check version). For reference, few such legal networks already exist. Such as RedHookWiFi, which proved to be a networking backbone during Hurricane Sandy disaster.
- **Mars:** New World Order. Network State. New concept of a state.

## EU Data Updates

**A lot of movement is currently happening in the EU around data!**

- **Update from Matt Prewitt, president of RadicalxChange Foundation:**
  - At the November community call, we shared the fact that a draft of the Data Governance Act had been leaked. It was quite similar to the work that RxC is doing with the Data Freedom Act, providing a framework to people to form collective bargaining groups.
  - Last week, the final, public version of the Data Governance Act was published. See [here](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act).
  - Interestingly, the official version focuses more on data intermediaries to help with their legal rights, where the leaked one was more about people delegating their legal rights. It looks like the final version took a step as the intermediaries might not change much. The delegation would have been way more powerful. It’s interesting to see the reluctance to use the idea of collective bargaining. There needs to be a change of belief that these unions will strengthen the individuals, not the contrary. Individuals acting alone without combining their efforts won’t have much power vis a vis any other entities on the other side of the market.
- **Additional Comments on the Subject:**
  - Collective bargaining has this old fashioned association with unions; we need a better model to describe it.
  - The data governance act seems to conflict with GDPR, which is now clearly impeding the next steps that should be happening.
  - Please note that MyData global has their conference next week. Register [here](https://mydata.org/mydata-conferences/). Discount for nonprofit.
  - Upcoming talk on local ecosystem sustainability by the EU on December 8. Register [here](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/data-driven-communities-fostering-local-data-ecosystem-sustainability).

See you next year, on Wednesday, January 6, 2021

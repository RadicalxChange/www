**Decision:** RadicalxChange Agenda 2022-2023  
**Description:** What activities should the RadicalxChange Foundation prioritize in 2022-2023?

- This ballot was curated from the following [Pol.is conversation](https://pol.is/report/r68d3xkynnmezw4brdwjh) by the RadicalxChange Foundation. We encourage you to explore the linked Polis report to get a sense of which ideas achieved the strongest consensus, and which were divisive.
- We attempted to faithfully translate all of the ideas in the Polis comments into logically distinct, actionable ballot proposals.
- The numbers in brackets indicate the Polis comments that support each ballot proposal. We have included a brief explanation in cases where: (1) it was difficult or confusing to translate a comment into a proposal; (2) we consolidated substantially overlapping comments into a single proposal; (3) we split a comment into two or more proposals; or (4) we declined to incorporate the ideas in a comment in a ballot proposal (for example, because the comment was too vague to be actionable).

## Annotated ballot

1. Provide clear guidelines, toolkit, educational materials & other resources to help chapters organize. [15] [32] ***We combined comments 15 and 32, because they both suggested that RadicalxChange focus on providing better resources to help chapters get running and stay organized.***
2. Leverage the newsletter, so interested members don't have to be on Discord 24/7. [24]
3. Improve the UI/UX of RxC Voice so that anyone can get their community/organization up and running quickly. [22] [25] ***We combined comments 22 and 25 because they both suggested that RadicalxChange prioritize improvements to the interfaces and user experience on RxC Voice in order to make it more useful.***
4. Open an application process through which organizations that meet specific criteria can receive free consulting and implementation of RxC Voice. [2]
5. Enable connection to web3 wallets on RxC Voice. [16]
6. Help organizations and communities experiment with RadicalxChange ideas in the real world. [9]
7. Make educational content to explain RadicalxChange ideas and philosophy to people without background in political economy / tech. [10]
8. RxC should produce English language videos about Taiwan's political reforms. Ideally vlog style with interviews, not lectures. [29]
9. Proliferate educational resources & cultural artifacts (e.g. videos, gifs, memes, etc) that help RadicalxChange concepts reach gen Z-ers & mainstream audiences. [11] [13] ***We combined comments 11 and 13, because they both suggested that RadicalxChange focus on producing memetic content that would reach a wider audience on the internet.***
10. Support the production of educational material on partial common ownership. [21]
11. Rather than data, let's focus on knowing. Societally-shared knowing. Comprehensively reflective. Ground-reported. e.g., from all colleges. Create collective-knowing websites. eg, no-water-HERE. [19] [20] ***We combined comments 19 and 20, because comment 20 seemed to suggest one example of an action that should be taken in order to honor the more general perspective expressed in comment 19.***
12. Focus on web3 governance as a top priority issue. [6] [7] ***We combined comments 6 and 7, because we felt that a positive vote for comment 7 would have expressed the same preference as a negative vote for comment 6.***
13. Focus on building tools. [4]
14. Encourage voices to volunteer identifiers (e.g. male, euro.) in dialogue with others for transparent pluralism. 'Real World' democracy requires diversity of stakeholders. [26]
15. Develop a name for RadicalxChange’s ideology and a polcomball wiki page and flag to go with it. [28]
16. Author a new book. Radical Markets is kind of outdated and lacks the right voice. It needs to be grounded yet aspirational. [31]
17. Promote data dignity (the term and its underlying ideas) and recommend policy to accelerate its implementation. [8]
18. Engage with DAOs wanting to adopt soulbound NFTs for their communities. [17]
19. Reward artists & content creators focused on pluralistic imaginaries, to give its theory a palpable texture, color & aesthetics. [14]
20. Create more podcasts. [23]
21. Operate more like an open-source project, using online tools that facilitate collaboration and exchange of knowledge. [12]
22. Develop shared symbolism and "mythology". Flags, songs, events, rituals, etc. Like how Georgists had the Land song. [30]
23. Help make Twitter a place that espouses the ideals we hold in the RadicalxChange community. [0] [1] ***We combined comments 0 and 1, because we felt that a positive vote for comment 1 would have expressed the same preference as a negative vote for comment 0.***


## Curation Meeting Notes

- Statement-by-statement discussion, adding clarification.
- Make statements symmetrical, e.g. starting with a verb.
- Maintain original wording of each statement, as much as possible.
- We considered combining [2] and [9] but felt that [9] concerns prioritizing community experiments broadly while [2] joins others in suggesting improvements to the Voice project itself.
- We removed comment 3, because it did not express a clear action for RadicalxChange to take.
- We removed comment 5, because it did not express a clear action for RadicalxChange to take.
- Order entries by topic (eg Voice, web3) to help voters consider trade-offs, complementarities, etc
- We removed comment 18, because it did not suggest an action for RadicalxChange Foundation to take. Instead, comment 18 was a question about the RxC Voice process; so we will answer that question here. The place to express the order and magnitude of your preferences is in the Quadratic Voting stage (Stage 3). The “voting” feature in the Conversation Stage (Stage 2) merely gives us a preliminary understanding of which comments were divisive, which were generally agreed upon, and which were confusing. This data helps inform our ballot curation process, and provides additional context and accountability to the results from Stage 3, but is ancillary to the results from Stage 3. Think of it like an exit poll in an election.
- We did not exactly understand what action comment 19 is suggesting for RadicalxChange; however, since 42% of respondents “agreed” with comment 19, we felt that our personal confusion was not sufficient grounds for removal from the ballot. If this comment is among the proposals that receive the highest votes in Stage 3, we will take steps to elucidate exactly what actions the community feels RadicalxChange should take in order to honor it.
- We removed comment 33, because it did not suggest a clear action for RadicalxChange. However, it did provide feedback about the RxC Voice user experience, and that feedback has been recorded. Note that Stage 2 is conducted using Pol.is, which is not maintained by RadicalxChange. Granular feedback on Pol.is features may be directed to The Computational Democracy Project.

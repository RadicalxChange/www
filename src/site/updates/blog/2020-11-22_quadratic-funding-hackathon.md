The Quadratic Funding hackathon [GitxChange2](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gitxchange2/?) has come to an end. GitxChange2 was a 4-week program designed by the RadicalxChange Foundation and Gitcoin to lay the ground for various Quadratic Funding (QF) ecosystems.

QF is a more democratic and scalable form of matching funding for public goods. **Public or common goods can be any project that is valuable to large groups of people and accessible to the general public**. You can find out more and play around with a quadratic funding tool at [wtfisqf.com](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000).

Gitcoin has shown that the math behind QF holds its promises in practice. [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) utilizes QF for public goods on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/). [Downtown Stimulus](https://downtownstimulus.com/) put QF in action for economic relief of local businesses in downtown Boulder, Colorado. This hackathon's primary goal was to take QF to many more causes for public goods.

## Distribute Emergence

We believe that Quadratic Funding can advance public goods of all kinds. The hackathon included a variety of prizes around the concept of QF. We brought together creative companies, nonprofits, governments, and individuals who would like to initiate more democratic and scalable funding for their cause.

## The Sponsors and Their Prizes

Eight sponsors participated in the GitxChange2 hackathon and posted thirteen prizes, problem-solving challenges with an attached bounty, amounting to a bounty sum of about \$18,000 (USD). \
 \
Here is the list of the sponsors and prizes.

- [Clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/) is an Ethereum-based QF protocol for efficiently allocating funds to public goods that benefit the Ethereum network. Their challenges for the hackathon were to [integrate Bright ID](https://gitcoin.co/issue/clrfund/monorepo/26/100023816) for identity verification and to [create a subgraph](https://gitcoin.co/issue/clrfund/monorepo/58/100023817), in other words, an open API for other projects to utilize the blockchain code of clr.fund.
- [Freelio](http://www.freeel.io/) and its Elecratseed Fund project aim to create equitable funding opportunities for clean energy access providers and posted two related challenges. [First](https://gitcoin.co/issue/Freeelio/electraseed-fund/14/100023833), making a meme to encourage crypto philanthropists to fund energy matching funds. [Second](https://gitcoin.co/issue/Freeelio/electraseed-fund/12/100023831), explaining how the Electraseed Fund can implement QF.
- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)'s mission is to grow and sustain open-source software. As Gitcoin Grants has become a vital QF ecosystem at scale, [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) resistance is crucial to ensure that nobody can work around the quadratic, democratic element. So the [prize](https://gitcoin.co/issue/gitcoinco/skunkworks/187/100023848) posted by Gitcoin is about adding additional identity verifiers to Gitcoin Grants that benefit accounts that use many verifiers.
- [Idena](https://idena.io/), a blockchain-based proof-of-personhood network, posted a related [prize](https://gitcoin.co/issue/idena-network/idena-desktop/454/100023832) for integrating Idena as a trust bonus in human verification of Gitcoin Grants.
- M+ Climate is quite an early stage project; its goal is to establish retired carbon dioxide credits as currency. They challenged hackers to [develop a QF ecosystem](https://gitcoin.co/issue/MPlus4Climate/MPlusToolKit/3/100023836) to democratically fund projects in the M+ Climate ecosystem. Moreover, they posted a prize to [create a video explanation](https://gitcoin.co/issue/MPlus4Climate/MPlusToolKit/2/100023835) of the M+ Climate project and [draft the M+ Climate currency token](https://gitcoin.co/issue/MPlus4Climate/MPlusToolKit/1/100023834).
- [Rarebirds](https://rarebirdshq.com/) is a support ecosystem for entrepreneurs in developing countries. Pursuing that mission, they [challenged](https://gitcoin.co/issue/RareBirdsLLC/rarebirds/3/100023826) the hackers to build a QF ecosystem dedicated to that cause.
- [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) is a platform for a thriving planet and agriculture in particular. Their [prize](https://gitcoin.co/issue/regen-network/regen-ledger/111/100023815) was about building a QF application for the Regen platform.
- RadicalxChange Foundation also posted two challenges. [One](https://gitcoin.co/issue/RadicalxChange/GitxChange/7/100023849) was more creative, asking participants to develop an expressive and exciting Internet meme to explain and spread the word about public goods. The other [prize](https://gitcoin.co/issue/RadicalxChange/GitxChange/5/100023819) was about building RadicalxChange Openfund, a QF platform for RadicalxChange projects. (Stay tuned for information about Openfund soon.)

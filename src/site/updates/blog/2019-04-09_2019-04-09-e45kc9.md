## Gitcoin, Civil and Bunz named winners of the inaugural RadicalxChange project showcase

450 leaders, activists, artists, entrepreneurs and scholars recently gathered in Detroit for the inaugural RadicalxChange conference. Though they comprised a richly diverse community, they were all attracted to the event through a shared interest in making the world work for all of humanity.

RadicalxChange sees the benefits and flaws of the often dualistic systemic choices we have in society–capitalism vs socialism, individualism vs collectivism, etc. As a community, we believe that experimentation in market mechanisms, social systems, technological tools, and governance structures are key to designing a better future.

Hence, RadicalxChange must be a laboratory for these experiments, and not just a place for dialogue and discourse.

For the inaugural event, ProjectxChange brought our radical ideas to life.

ProjectxChange was an interactive project showcase that presented 13 radical mechanisms and concepts in action. Using [Quadratic Voting](http://radicalmarkets.com/chapters/radical-democracy/) in its first known use of judging a conference showcase, each attendee voted to determine which three projects were selected to present during Sunday’s program on stage.

The three winning teams were:

- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), a platform to monetize or incentivize work in Open Source Software;
- [Civil](https://civil.co/) (Media Company), a community-owned journalism network based on transparency and trust; and
- [Bunz](https://bunz.com/), a digital currency-based bartering platform.

Other featured projects included: Decentraland, UBDI, The Artwork that is Always of Sale, Democracy Earth, Streamr, Pack Technologies, Regulr, WeThePeeps, 3Box, and Gribouilli. They were selected from an initial application pool of over 40 projects.

RadicalxChange communities exist around the world, with over 20 chapters and growing. Find the list of local chapters holding regular gatherings here: [Find Your Local RxC Chapter](/chapters)

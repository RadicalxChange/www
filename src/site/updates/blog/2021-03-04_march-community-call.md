## Action Items

*Let's start first with the future before talking about the past*
- Communicate more details on RadicalxChange Voice app for beta testing (Alex Randaccio)
- Invite chapter members to Discord (Angela Corpus)
- Set up an working group on AI ethics and governance (Fanny Lakoubay)
- Cross communicate between RadicalxChange and Pol.is community (Patcon)

## RxC Community Updates

- **David Krueger‚Äôs** announcement:
  - ‚ÄúI'll be starting tenure-track faculty position in Machine Learning at Cambridge in the CBL group. My research focuses on Deep Learning and AI Alignment. I'd like to increase cross-pollination between RadicalXChange and the AI Alignment community. The AI Alignment community itself is sort of split into 2 camps: "near-term" and "long-term". Despite a number of differences, both real and apparent, between RXC and AI alignment, and between the two camps, I believe all 3 communities are natural allies. Although I don't have any specific research ideas related to RXC right now, I would be very interested in supporting research that connects RXC-adjacent ideas (and not just mechanism design!) within my research group. I am looking for students and expect to continue growing my group over the coming years.‚Äù
- **Gitcoin** is looking for an awesome React developer for https://fundoss.org/, a pilot matching campaign based on a democratic funding model (retweet Kevin‚Äôs [tweet](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1367163992372781057) or reach out to him).

- **Lucas Chu**
  - Check out the world‚Äôs first hack+policython (hackpolicy.co/), exponential tech conference, and/or the [Canadian Undergrad Tech Conference](http://cutc.ca) organized by Lucas Chu (opportunity to speak, mentor or judge).
  - Reach out to [Lucas Chu](mailto:lucaschu@college.harvard.edu) for an invitation to do a quick fireside with the Harvard Economics Review, Political Review, or GenZMafia startup server

00:44:21	patcon (he/him):	In that it‚Äôs ‚Äúclosed‚Äù and shareable, but still has 4 groups

00:44:38	Tom Lyons:	Have to jump now I am afraid and feed the kids. @Fanny/Angela, see you in Discord. One thought on the AI topic to leave you with: is it going to take over the world, or just make us all quietly redundant? Cheers all.

00:44:44	patcon (he/him):	I‚Äôve founds conversations with up to 5 groups (though sometimes that‚Äôs an artifact to have so many)

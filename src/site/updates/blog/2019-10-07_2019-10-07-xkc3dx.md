  - RxC Community Calls
---

We have had a bit of issues with town hall scheduling: on the first two calls (August and September), the daylight saving times have been wrong in Google calendars, making people log in at the end of both calls. This time for the 3rd call, we made sure to list a lot of different time zones but messed up the days in a tweet btw Tuesday and Wednesday…

We were however very happy to connect with the RXC community sitting on the East side of the world before Devcon5 Osaka and other major initiatives happening in Asia.

Read through to the detailed minutes to learn more about many many things happening around RXC concepts and applications.

## Main takeaways

- Radical Markets book is now available in Chinese in China.
- Upcoming events with RXC members include:
  - Defi.wtf event in Osaka on October 7 where QV might be tested to be used to attribute panel speaker seats. [See details >](https://www.defi.wtf/)
  - Two talks on the main stage at Devcon5 on October 10 by Audrey Tang (What the foundation has accomplished and what the impact has been so far) and Zoe Hitzig (RXC 2.0: what to expect in the future) + many other side talks/meetups with quadratic voting applications being discussed. [See details >](https://www.devcon.org/agenda)

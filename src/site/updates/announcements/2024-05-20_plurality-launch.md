Plurality offers a new way forward for technology and democracy. This co-created book shares the ideas that enabled Taiwan’s 1st Digital Minister Audrey Tang and her collaborators – the architects of Taiwan’s internationally acclaimed digital democracy – to achieve inclusive, technology-fueled growth. These promise to transform every sector, as well as strengthen social unity and diversity. The book was co-written as an open-source project by a multinational community of enthusiasts. We invite your participation and support in developing Plurality!

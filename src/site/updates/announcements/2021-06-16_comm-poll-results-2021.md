To the Community of RadicalxChange Foundation Ltd.:

In keeping with our goal and promise to make the RadicalxChange Foundation democratically governed and accountable, the RxC team built a new participatory governance application called RxC Voice, combining liquid democracy, online deliberation, and quadratic voting. Having just concluded the first instance of this large-scale collective decision pilot, here are the results for the question posed: 'What activities should the RadicalxChange Foundation prioritize in 2021-2022?'

The experiment ran from May 17th to June 8th, 2021 and was structured in three foundational stages: (1) Delegation, (2) Deliberation, and (3) Election. Prior to the event, the RxC Foundation team put out an open call inviting members of the community to take part in the pilot. Out of around 150 who requested to take part or were invited, 68 signed up and participated in the process by delegating voice credits to fellow representatives, engaging in a democratic conversation via [Polis](https://pol.is/home), ratifying the resulting [ballot curated by RxC Foundation](/updates/announcements/community-poll-ballot-2021/), and prioritizing the ballot's 54 proposals in a quadratic vote. In the end the democratic process ran smoothly and resulted in actionable and valuable takeaways.

While all of the proposals are recognized, here are the top 5 ranked by votes:
(For the complete proposal ranking, see the appendix below)

1. Develop and refine RxC Voice with the aim of making it useful to other organizations, communities, or blockchain groups. (72 votes)
2. Develop RxC Voice as an open source project via a community of users and developers who are willing to contribute work or money. (60 votes)
3. Produce high-quality media (e.g. videos, presentations, podcasts) to communicate ideas more broadly. (54 votes)
4. Develop RxC software to facilitate pilots of RxC ideas by chapters and others. (54 votes)
5. Explore solutions outside of crypto/blockchain that relate to ideas identified in Radical Markets. (54 votes)

There was a strong mandate for the RadicalxChange Foundation to continue to develop RxC Voice and provide governance tools to all kinds of communities, which we will do.  We also noted the strong support of our content creation. We will redouble our efforts to increase the frequency and caliber of presentations, podcasts, and other media, always striving to better communicate RxC ideas and facilitate discourse. The community signaled that RadicalxChange might be too focused on crypto and blockchain projects. While we maintain that RadicalxChange is not a crypto or blockchain focused community, we will make a concerted effort to broaden the dialogue and exposure of non-crypto and blockchain RxC and RM solutions, projects, and developing ideas.

These were just a few of the many valuable signals expressed in this experiment. Overall, we were delighted with the quality of participation from the delegates, and are really thrilled to have this new mechanism for community governance available to us. Thank you to all who participated and took the time to share their insights. And thanks to all RadicalxChange friends for the energy you continue to bring to the community!

_As part of the evolving intellectual agenda of RadicalxChange, we see three emerging areas of inter-related research: the first relating to the problem of how we conceive of identity as social intersection rather than individuation; the second related to speculative design and the third on finding intersections for the fields of emotions studies and mechanism design. The first area has already led to some working papers. For the second, see the attached description of Jennifer Morone’s new project,_ The Scheme of Things*. For a working bibliography for thinking about how to bring emotion studies into conversation with mechanism design, see the sections of the bibliography devoted to each below.*

## Emotions Studies

_The following is meant to be a sample of the scholarship from a wide range of disciplines we might begin to draw upon as we consider how to bring this area of research into conversation with mechanism design for RadicalxChange. The foundational work of Norbert Elias’ relational sociology, especially his concept of homines aperti, his pioneering interest in emotions and in utopian thinking may be especially productive as a starting point for approaching emotions studies as social scientists interested in radical social change and humane mechanism design. A complete list of his works can be found [here](http://www.ucdpress.ie/results.asp?sf1=eh_cat_class&st1=F100&sort=sort_date/d&ds=Elias+Collected+Works) but for our purposes, Vols. 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14 (especially essays 2, 10-12), 15 (essays 6, 9); 16 (essays 1-7, 12, 14-17). Thinking about emotions also allows us to consider cultural difference in politico-economic decision-making, which is important given our global reach._

## Knowledge and Plurality

_Plurality is beneficial in the search for knowledge. Institutional epistemology is a field of research into the properties of institutional arrangements and social system in terms of their conduciveness to learning, problem-solving and knowledge-attainment in general. One of the founding insights of institutional epistemology is that groups of diverse investigators outperform groups of best investigators in resolving complex problems, and one of its central research focuses are the conditions under which plurality exhibits high epistemic value. The following texts include the classical epistemological accounts of the value of plurality and the relevant contemporary pluralist developments in political philosophy after the “epistemic turn”._

Introducing and soliciting collaboration on *Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy*

We are about to embark on a journey and hope you will join us. Over the past half decade we have, in collaboration with so many of you, been developing an alternative to the usual narratives about the future of technology that focus on financialization or centralized artificial intelligence. *Plurality*, as we call it, is technology that recognizes, honors, and empowers cooperation across social and cultural differences. You can learn a bit more about it in the overview below. We believe Plurality is the natural technological paradigm to support the flourishing of democratic societies and can overcome many of the entrenched divisions in our world today. We want to tell the world about this possibility so we can stimulate the diverse and coordinated investment and experimentation that can make it a reality. And we want your help.

While our precise plan will evolve with the advances in Plurality research and practical realities, we are committed to embodying the ideas of the book in the way we create, distribute, and financially support it. All material will be a Free Cultural Work, among the most permissive category of Creative Commons license. We plan to write the book in public in a git-like structure, where we will solicit editorial and research assistance openly from the community and enlist those who contribute to help us prioritize pull requests and eventually control the contents of the book. We will support the financial expenses of making the book available using a range of aligned, web3-native mechanisms, including Plural/Quadratic Funding grants, NFT “signatures” on physical and digital purchased copies of the book and SALSA/Harberger NFTs for access to Glen as a speaker/consultant based on the book. We will represent a range of roles contributing to the book using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) and will use these as the foundation for governing choices about the content after physical publication, including the disposition of much of the funds raised, roughly converting the book’s community into a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO). We will be partnering closely with Protocol Labs (PL) to build the technology substrate to make this work and hopefully help invent a new model of publishing for the web3 era.

At the same time, as pluralists, we don’t want to reach only “web3 natives”, and as such we hope to make it a beautiful physical object, widely accessible, distributed and reviewed in standard publishing and media channels. Thus, we need not just hackers and writers, but also designers, storytellers, marketers, translators, publishers and so forth to work with us. And we understand that some of these will prefer more individual entitlements over governance rights on speculative potential cash flows, possibilities we are open to negotiating with partners who share our goals and vision along other dimensions. In any case, neither Audrey nor Glen will receive any compensation nor royalties for their work on the text, to comply with legal responsibilities associated with their employment and to ensure that any revenue supports our mission and the community we hope to build.

We will soon be debuting the software platform that will support our writing in public and managing of participation, but if you perceive a way you want to contribute prior to that, please feel free to [write to Glen](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org). The future of technology can honor and support the values we hold dear if we work together to imagine and explain it.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Technology and democracy are at war: technology bolsters authoritarian surveillance and corrodes democratic institutions, while democracies fight back with constraining regulation and public sector conservatism. Yet this conflict is not inevitable; it is a choice we have made to invest in anti-democratic technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cryptocurrencies. A few places, such as the Ethereum community, Estonia, the state of Colorado and especially Taiwan, have instead focused on technologies that empower diverse collaboration and have seen democracy and technology flourish together. This book, by the leaders of this new paradigm of Plurality, shows for the first time how every technologist, policymaker, business leader and activist can harness it to build a more collaborative, diverse, and productively democratic world.

When Uber arrived in Taiwan, its presence was divisive, just as it has been in much of the world. But rather than social media pouring fuel on this flame, the vTaiwan platform that one of us developed as a minister there empowered citizens opining on the issue to have a thoughtful, deliberative conversation with thousands of participants on how ride hailing should be regulated. This technology harnessed statistical tools often associated with AI to cluster opinion, allowing every participant to quickly digest the clearest articulation of the viewpoints of their fellow citizens and contribute back their own thoughts. The views that drew support from across the initial lines of division rose to the top, forming a rough consensus that ensured the benefits of the new ride hailing tools while also protecting workers’ rights and was implemented by the government. This process has been used to resolve dozens of contentious issues in Taiwan and is rapidly spreading around the world to governments, cooperatives and blockchain communities.

Yet vTaiwan just scratches the surface of how technology can be designed to perceive, honor and bridge social differences for collaboration. New voting and financing rules emerging from the Ethereum ecosystem can reshape how we govern the public and private sectors; immersive virtual worlds are empowering empathetic connections that cross lines of social exclusion; social networks and newsfeeds can be engineered to build social cohesion and shared sensemaking, rather than driving us apart. And, as Taiwan’s experience has shown, the potential social benefits are vast, enabling the world’s best response to a range of recent crises from the Covid pandemic to misinformation to the creating broadly shared prosperity.

Yet while a few countries and ecosystems have put tens of millions of dollars into such technologies, the rest of the world has poured hundreds of billions into AI and Crypto, which pursue fundamentally different goals. AI aims to automate away human participation, centralizing power, strengthening autocracies, and undermining the middle class. Speculative cryptocurrencies, addictive social media and escapist “metaverses” have undermined the social fabric, reinforced social divisions, spread an infodemic and proliferated criminality. It is little surprise, then, that the countries that have invested in these technologies see democracy and technology as enemies.

But it is not too late to change paths: we can invest in technologies that establish digital human rights, empower pluralism and flourish in democratic societies, allowing them to outperform authoritarianism and hyper-capitalism. We can invest to give every person an inalienable right to digital personhood with a new generation of decentralized identity (DID) technologies that empower every person to travel, transact, conduct business, and participate in democratic communities free from centralized surveillance. We can make freedom of association real in the digital world with community-managed and accountable social networks and ledgers that form the town halls and public squares of the future while bridging the growing divides between groups. We can secure digital property rights by creating the public markets and main streets of the future with cryptographic technologies for the secure and privacy-preserving sharing of data, computation, and storage across peers, free from the control of platform monopolists. We can secure the right to commerce with government-supported, privacy-preserving, internationally interoperable digital currencies. And we can enable every citizen to access these rights by making high speed internet a human right and digital competence education core to public school curricula.

Securing these fundamental digital human rights makes pluralism in the digital world not just possible, but natural. In Taiwan, the ideographic characters for “digital” and “plural” are the same: 數位. The experience there and in similar ecosystems has shown how these foundations, even in nascent form, promotes flourishing democracy. Secure and private identities allow citizens to participate in thoughtful deliberations and reasoned compromise, as in vTaiwan, without facing attacks from trolls and bots. Private data sharing allows neighborhoods and communities to provide services (from pollution monitoring to mask availability maps) for themselves rather relying on proprietary platforms. Open and reliable payments allow creative forms of crowdfunding to support shared goods without heavy-handed bureaucracies. Peer-to-peer reputation systems empower civil society to combat misinformation, often with humor, while maintaining vibrant and open speech.

Furthermore, while these tools can transform the public sector around the world, they are not only relevant or even primarily, relevant to national democracies. Instead, they offer a way for every organization, from churches to corporations, to foster more productive and dynamic cooperation. Companies can empower intrapreneurship and cross-divisional infrastructure faster than ever before. Private and sovereign data sharing can contain and cure disease. A new media landscape can simultaneously be more trustworthy and consensual on key facts than ever before while empowering voices marginalized by traditional gate-keepers. Plurality is thus not for politics and government alone, any more than the internet was for the military and universities that first built it. Instead, it is a new technological paradigm that can transform every sector and the lives of every individual for the better if we learn how to harness it.

But just like the internet and other transformative technologies, Plurality will only thrive to the extent we invest in it. The internet began as a network established by the United States Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET) to experiment with new decentralized user interface designs. Yet the vision of ARPANET’s founders, like JCR Licklider, on which ours is closely modeled, was only very partially realized because it never mobilized the public and international support and multisectoral investment needed to follow it through. Instead, as Licklider predicted, it was mostly captured by monopolists who stymied its potential. Today we have the chance to correct that mistake and build a future where our technologies express and empower our highest ideals, rather than degrading them. Every activist, artist, technologist, citizen, policymaker and organization has a key role to play in the struggle for that future.

<div class="markdown markdown-sm italic text-center mt-12 mb-12">

When we see “internet of things”, let’s make it an internet of beings.

When we see “virtual reality”, let’s make it a shared reality.

When we see “machine learning”, let’s make it collaborative learning.

When we see “user experience”, let’s make it about human experience.

When we hear “the singularity is near”, let us remember: the plurality is here.

<h2>Chapter outline</h2>

Below is an outline divided into parts and chapters. Each chapter lists estimated page length and gives a summary of the argument of the relevant chapter, in a proportion of roughly one sentence to each 5 pages. All of this is a first draft sketch.

<div class="html">
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
  <li>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5em">
      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Preface: Seeing Plural</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(5 pages):</p>
    </div>We will open the book with a poetic-spiritual reflection on the omnipresence of plurality at every scale of reality and what an extension of this into our technological future might feel like.
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5em">
      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Introduction: The War Between Democracy and Technology</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(10 pages):</p>
    </div> The headline-grabbing conflicts between tech and democracy at once reflect and conceal a deeper tension between the directions technology has developed and the principles of a democratic society. While specific technologies that have come out of the AI and web3 traditions have significant potential, they are fundamentally anti-democratic political ideologies rather than technologies, committed to the centralization of power and extreme individualism respectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Plurality</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Living in a Plural World (15 pages): From the most basic physical level of quantum mechanics to the greatest heights, “beauty, growth, progress – all result from the union of the unlike.” (Star Trek quote). These all therefore depend on maintaining and proliferating diversity, while also strengthening communication and cooperation across difference. Information and communications technology can map the dynamic landscape of social relationships and facilitate new connections and organizations that span such networks.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Lost Dao (15 pages) The idea of a network society, where individuals and social groups are both dynamic intersections of each other, originated in the theories of sociologists, economists and philosophers like Henry George, Georg Simmel and John Dewey. This vision was the foundation of what become the internet, but was never articulated with philosophical clarity, allowing it to be forgotten and superseded by other philosophies, focused on imitation of human intelligence or the liberation of individuals from social bonds. This book aims to recover that lost vision, show how it has and can succeed and chart a path forward for it to flourish.
      </li>
      <li>
        A View from Yu Shan (20 pages) Taiwan sits at the intersection of the continental plates of Eurasia and America, and at the ideological intersection of the Chinese centralized AI ideology, the American hyper-capitalist ideology and European values-based regulatory states. As the physical fault line has pushed the highest point in Taiwan, Yu Shan, higher, so too these ideological tensions have pushed Taiwan to develop a pluralist synthesis that allowed it to become the most technologically advanced and most actively democratic country in the world. This chapter will give a vivid and emotive portrait of the life in Taiwan’s digital democracy from multiple vantage points: that of the minister, that of a civic activist, that of an ordinary digitally disengaged citizen, that of a businessperson, etc. It will also briefly tell the history of how Taiwan’s digital democracy emerged, drawing parallels and contrasts to the circumstances of other liberal democratic countries today.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Freedom</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Human Rights as an Operating System (5 pages) Just as industrial democracies are built on the foundation of universal human rights, digital democracies depend on the universal defense of human rights in the digital realm. Access to these capabilities is currently limited and proprietary, undermining the potential of Plurality. Each chapter in this section will begin with a short sketch of an interaction that the realization of this right will enable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personhood (10 pages) The rights to life, travel and personal recognition are the most fundamental of rights and yet the identity systems that make these possible online are controlled by a few proprietary platforms. Decentralized and pluralistic identity systems that are now emerging from the web3 space can empower a range of new functionalities that take the internet as far beyond its current state as the internet took prior modes of communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Association (10 pages) Social networks map association in the digital age, while blockchains provide the digital equivalent of public squares. If these can be extended by public-interested investment to enrich the reputation and social relationships these convey, they have the potential to extend the reach of social relationships far broader beyond today and substitute for many of the functions traditionally assigned to anonymous market exchange.
      </li>
      <li>
        Commerce (5 pages) With the participation of legitimate institutions (such as central banks, governments and banks), digital currencies can have a network structure that allows both the benefits of sovereignty and privacy and of international interoperability, freeing payments both from the chaos of cryptocurrencies and the inefficient monopolies that currently dominate payments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Property (10 pages) While the fundamental assets of the digital world (data, computation and memory) are created in a distributed manner, the lack of open standards for securely sharing them has concentrated power in a few big tech companies. Public investment in developing open standards for secure sharing in these areas will allow civil society and business groups to achieve far more ambitious collaboration, more efficiently, with greater trust, privacy, and sovereignty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Access and education (5 pages) Online human rights are only relevant to those who can access and navigate cyberspace. High speed broadband access and digital competence, not just literacy, education must therefore be universal human rights.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Democracy</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Democracy as Applications (10 pages) Democratic institutions are applications that can run on these foundations and have three fundamental components: deliberation, compromise and pluralism. These institutions can not only transform the public sector but also the private sector, democratizing business, and depend in turn on such democratized financing models. Each chapter will begin with a vignette of ways technologies are being used today to achieve digital democracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliberation (5 pages) Advances in statistics (often associated with AI) make it possible “broad listening”, where millions of people can hear the distilled essence of the distribution of opinion of their peers, empowering democratic deliberation at scale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compromise (5 pages) Advances in mechanism design (often associated with web3) make compromise and horse-trading at scale possible, allowing direct democracy that doesn’t fall into the traps of tyranny of the majority.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pluralism (5 pages) Social networks allow us to trace social cleavages and divisions, allowing us to both empower “local” communities to self-govern and to actively create incentives for bridging these divides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finance (5 pages) New forms of social organization emerging from the web3 community allow us to transcend the market-state divide by creating an emergent social sector that can provide democratic services at scale.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5em">
      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Impact</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(Intro 5 pages):</p>
    </div> Democracy has gotten a bad reputation in much of the world for failing to deliver on critical global challenges. This is because it hasn’t kept pace with technology; when it does, Taiwan’s experience shows it can outperform authoritarian regime. Each chapter will highlight statistics illustrating the success possible in countries like Taiwan and Estonia that have made digital democracy a reality.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Media (5 pages) Misinformation can be contained while maintaining vibrant free speech with algorithms that surface content with surprising consensus and active participation of civil society groups that harness humor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Health (5 pages) Pandemics and other public health crises can be identified and responded with agility and minimal economic costs if civil society can rapidly design systems for allocating scarce health resources and targeting chains of transmission.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment (5 pages) Environmental harms, from the local to the global, can quickly be identified without invading privacy if citizens can form horizontal “data coalitions” that can bargain with governments to live up to their responsibilities and ensure community members do the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jobs (5 pages) By harnessing digital technologies for human engagement rather than replacement, digital technologies can create better jobs than they eclipse, leading to naturally broadly shared prosperity and participation.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Forward</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Institutions (20 pages) The large-scale investment necessary to realize Plurality will require fusing together funding sources from a variety of sectors and countries to combine and transcend the motives of national interest, profit and charity. Experimentation with diverse communities across many geographic locations will have to closely tie to the standardization that can achieve international scale, harnessing a network of digital ministers like that in Taiwan. Private sector businesses, academic institutions, charitable organizations, and activists will all have to be drawn into contributions lured by the prestige and vision of the future that comes with contributing to the future of open standards. While ambitious, this plan largely extends the history of the internet stimulated by the network of user research laboratories funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET), extending it to our current multipolar world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Action (10 pages) While success will require coordination at the highest levels, every citizen has a role to play to build the momentum to make this possible. We will show how hackers, investors, businesspeople, activists, artists, voters all can be part of a movement to make our tools serve our values rather than be dictated by them.

Einführung und Aufforderung zur Zusammenarbeit an Pluralität: Technologie für kollaborative Diversität und Demokratie

von Audrey Tang und E. Glen Weyl

*German translation by Leon Erichsen and Josephine Görke*

Wir stehen am Anfang einer Reise und hoffen, dass Sie sich uns anschließen werden. Im letzten halben Jahrzehnt haben wir gemeinsam mit vielen von Ihnen eine Alternative zu den üblichen Erzählungen über die Zukunft der Technologie entwickelt, die sich auf Finanzierung oder zentralisierte künstliche Intelligenz konzentrieren. *Pluralität*, wie wir sie nennen, ist Technologie, die die Zusammenarbeit über soziale und kulturelle Unterschiede hinweg anerkennt, würdigt und fördert. In der nachstehenden Übersicht erfahren Sie mehr darüber. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass Pluralität das natürliche technologische Leitbild ist, um das Gedeihen demokratischer Gesellschaften zu unterstützen, und dass es viele der tief verwurzelten Spaltungen in unserer heutigen Welt überwinden kann. Wir wollen die Welt über diese Möglichkeit informieren, damit wir vielfältige und koordinierte Investitionen und Experimente anregen können, welche diese Möglichkeit verwirklichen können. Und wir bitten um Ihre Hilfe.

Während sich unser präziser Plan mit Fortschritten in der Pluralitätsforschung und den praktischen Realitäten weiterentwickeln wird, sind wir entschlossen, die Ideen des Buches in der Art und Weise zu verkörpern, wie wir es schreiben, verbreiten und finanziell unterstützen. Das gesamte Material wird ein freies kulturelles Werk sein, eine der offensten Kategorien der Creative-Commons-Lizenz. Wir planen, das Buch öffentlich in einer Git-ähnlichen Struktur zu schreiben, in der wir gezielt um redaktionelle und wissenschaftliche Unterstützung aus der Öffentlichkeit bitten. Diejenigen, die dazu beitragen, laden wir ein, uns dabei zu helfen, Pull Requests zu priorisieren und schließlich den Inhalt des Buches zu kontrollieren. Wir werden die finanziellen Ausgaben für die Bereitstellung des Buches mit einer Reihe von übereinstimmenden, Web3-basierten Mechanismen unterstützen. Darunter sind Mechanismen wie Plurale Quadratische Finanzierungsprogramme, NFT-"Unterschriften" auf physisch und digital gekauften Exemplaren des Buches sowie die Versteigerung selbst bewerteter NFT-Lizenzen für den Zugang zu Glen als Sprecher/Berater auf der Grundlage des Buches. Wir werden mit Hilfe von Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) eine Reihe von Aufgaben für Beiträge zum Buch vermitteln und diese Tokens als Grundlage für Entscheidungen über den Inhalt nach der physischen Veröffentlichung verwenden, einschließlich der Verfügung über einen Großteil der gesammelten Gelder, wobei wir die Gemeinde des Buches quasi in eine Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) transformieren werden. Wir werden eng mit Protocol Labs (PL) zusammenarbeiten, um die technologische Grundlage hierfür zu schaffen, und hoffentlich dabei helfen, ein neues Modell des Publizierens für das Web3-Zeitalter zu entwickeln.

Gleichzeitig wollen wir als Pluralist\*innen nicht, dass das Buch nur "Web3-Natives" erreicht, und so hoffen wir, ein schönes physisches Objekt zu kreieren, das allgemein zugänglich ist und über herkömmliche Verlags- und Medienkanäle verbreitet und rezensiert wird. Wir brauchen also nicht nur Hacker\*innen und Autor\*innen, sondern auch Designer\*innen, Berichterstatter\*innen, Vermarkter\*innen, Verleger\*innen und so weiter, die mit uns zusammenarbeiten. Und wir sind uns bewusst, dass einige jener individuellere Ansprüche als Stimmrechte auf spekulative potenzielle Geldflüsse bevorzugen werden. Wir sind offen für Verhandlungen mit Partner\*innen, die unsere Ziele und Visionen in verschiedenen Dimensionen teilen. In jedem Fall werden weder Audrey noch Glen für ihre Arbeit an dem Text Vergütung oder Lizenzgebühren erhalten, um die mit ihren Anstellungen verbundenen rechtlichen Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen und um sicherzustellen, dass alle Einnahmen unsere Mission und die Gemeinschaft, die wir aufzubauen hoffen, unterstützen.

Wir werden in Kürze die Software-Plattform vorstellen, die unser Schreiben in der Öffentlichkeit und Verwaltung der Teilnahme unterstützen wird. Wenn Sie schon vorher eine Möglichkeit sehen sollten, einen Beitrag zu leisten, [schreiben Sie bitte Glen](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org). Die Zukunft der Technologie kann die Werte, die uns wichtig sind, ehren und unterstützen, wenn wir gemeinsam daran arbeiten, sie auszumalen und zu erklären.

<h2>Überblick</h2>

Technologie und Demokratie stehen auf Kriegsfuß: Technologie fördert autoritäre Überwachung und untergräbt demokratische Institutionen, während Demokratien mit restriktiver Regulierung und konservativem öffentlichen Sektor zurückschlagen. Doch dieser Konflikt ist nicht unvermeidlich. Vielmehr haben wir uns entschieden, in antidemokratische Technologien wie künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und Kryptowährungen zu investieren. Einige wenige Beispiele, wie die Ethereum-Gemeinde, Estland, der Bundesstaat Colorado und vor allem Taiwan, haben sich stattdessen auf Technologien konzentriert, die vielfältige Zusammenarbeit ermöglichen – jene Gemeinschaften haben erlebt, wie Demokratie und Technologie gemeinsam gedeihen. Dieses Buch von den Vorreiter\*innen des neuen Leitbildes der Pluralität zeigt zum ersten Mal, wie jede\*r Technolog\*in, politische Entscheidungsträger\*in, Unternehmensleiter\*in und Aktivist\*in es sich zunutze machen kann, um eine kollaborativere, vielfältigere und produktivere demokratische Welt aufzubauen.

Ähnlich wie es in vielen anderen Ländern der Welt der Fall war, sorgte das Auftauchen von Uber in Taiwan für Uneinigkeit. Doch statt das Problem durch soziale Medien weiter anzuheizen, ermöglichte die von einem von uns als Ministerin entwickelte vTaiwan-Plattform den Bürger\*innen, die sich zu dem Thema äußern wollten, eine fundierte Diskussion mit Tausenden von Teilnehmer\*innen darüber, wie der Fahrtenvermittlungsdienst reguliert werden sollte. Diese Technologie nutzte häufig mit künstlicher Intelligenz assoziierte statistische Verfahren, um Meinungen zu gruppieren, so dass jede\*r Teilnehmer\*in unmittelbar die am klarsten formulierten Standpunkte seiner Mitbürger verstehen und seine eigenen Gedanken dazu beitragen konnte. Die Standpunkte, die sich über verschiedene Differenzen hinweg durchsetzten, fanden den Weg an die Spitze und bildeten einen groben Konsens, der die Vorteile des neuen Fahrtenvermittlungsdienstes gewährleistete und gleichzeitig die Rechte der Arbeitnehmer\*innen schützte. Schließlich wurden Regulierungen entsprechend des groben Konsens von der Regierung in Kraft gesetzt. Dieses Verfahren wurde bereits zur Lösung zahlreicher strittiger Fragen in Taiwan eingesetzt und findet in Regierungen, Genossenschaften und Blockchain-Gemeinschaften auf der ganzen Welt rasche Anwendung.

Doch vTaiwan ist nur ein Vorgeschmack darauf, wie Technologie konzipiert werden kann, um soziale Differenzen wahrzunehmen, zu würdigen und für Zusammenarbeit zu überwinden. Neue Wahl- und Finanzierungsverfahren, die aus dem Ethereum-Ökosystem hervorgehen, können die Verwaltung des öffentlichen und privaten Sektors neu gestalten; realitätsnahe virtuelle Welten ermöglichen zwischenmenschliche Verbindungen, die soziale Ausgrenzung überwinden; soziale Netzwerke und Newsfeeds können so gestaltet werden, dass sie sozialen Zusammenhalt und gemeinsames Bewusstsein fördern, anstatt uns auseinander zu treiben. Und wie die Erfahrungen Taiwans zeigen, sind die potenziellen gesellschaftlichen Vorteile unermesslich und bieten der Welt optimale Möglichkeiten, auf eine Reihe aktueller Krisen zu reagieren - von der Covid-Pandemie über Fehlinformationen bis hin zum Aufbau eines breit angelegten gemeinsamen Wohlstands.

Doch während einige wenige Länder und Ökosysteme zweistellige Millionenbeträge in diese Art von Technologien investiert haben, hat der Rest der Welt Hunderte von Milliarden in KI und Kryptowährungen fließen lassen, welche grundlegend anders gepolt sind. KI strebt nach der Automatisierung menschlicher Tätigkeiten, der Zentralisierung von Macht, der Stärkung von Autokratien und der Verdrängung der Mittelschicht. Spekulative Kryptowährungen, süchtig machende soziale Medien und entgleisende "Metaverses" haben die Gesellschaft ausgehöhlt, soziale Spaltungen verstärkt, eine Infodemie erzeugt und Kriminalität vermehrt. Es ist daher kaum überraschend, dass die Länder, die in diese Technologien investiert haben, Demokratie und Technologie als Feinde betrachten. Darüber hinaus schaden diese Ansätze nicht nur der Gesellschaft, sondern auch der Grundstruktur des physikalischen Universums, dessen Quantenstruktur, wie jüngst nachgewiesen, auf pluralistischen Prinzipien beruht, sowie unserer lebendigen Erde, die von ökologischer Vielfalt erfüllt ist.

Allerdings ist es noch nicht zu spät, um einen Umschwung einzuleiten: Wir können in Technologien investieren, die digitale Menschenrechte einführen, Pluralismus stärken und demokratische Gesellschaften voranbringen, damit sie Autoritarismus und Hyperkapitalismus in den Schatten stellen können. Wir können investieren, um jedem Menschen ein unveräußerliches Recht auf digitale Persönlichkeit zu geben, indem wir eine neue Generation dezentraler Identitätstechnologien entwickeln, die es jedem Menschen ermöglichen, frei von zentraler Überwachung zu reisen, Geschäfte zu tätigen und an demokratischen Gemeinschaften teilzunehmen. Wir können die Vereinigungsfreiheit in der digitalen Welt mit gemeinschaftlich verwalteten und rechenschaftspflichtigen sozialen Netzwerken und Registern verwirklichen, die die Rathäuser und öffentlichen Plätze der Zukunft bilden und gleichzeitig die wachsenden Gräben zwischen Gruppen überbrücken. Wir können digitale Eigentumsrechte sichern, indem wir die öffentlichen Märkte und Hauptstraßen der Zukunft mit kryptografischen Technologien für sichere und private gemeinsame Nutzung von Daten, Berechnungen und Speicherplatz unter Gleichgesinnten schaffen, frei von der Kontrolle durch monopolistische Plattformen. Wir können das Recht auf Handel mit staatlich unterstützten, datenschutzkonformen, international kompatiblen digitalen Währungen sichern. Und wir können allen Bürger\*innen den Zugang zu diesen Rechten ermöglichen, indem wir schnelles Internet zu einem Menschenrecht und die Vermittlung digitaler Kompetenzen zum Kernbestandteil der Lehrpläne öffentlicher Schulen machen.

Die Sicherung dieser grundlegenden digitalen Menschenrechte macht Pluralismus in der digitalen Welt nicht nur möglich, sondern natürlich. In Taiwan sind die Schriftzeichen für "digital" und "plural" dieselben: 數位. Die Erfahrungen dort und in ähnlichen Ökosystemen haben gezeigt, wie diese Grundlagen, selbst in der Entstehungsphase, eine lebendige Demokratie fördern. Sichere und private Identitäten ermöglichen es den Bürger\*innen, an fundierten Debatten und Kompromissen mitzuwirken, wie in vTaiwan, ohne Angriffe von Trollen und Bots ertragen zu müssen. Die gemeinsame Nutzung privater Daten ermöglicht es Stadtvierteln und Gemeinden, Dienste (von der Überwachung der Umweltverschmutzung bis hin zu Karten über die Verfügbarkeit von Atemschutzmasken) unabhängig zu betreiben, anstatt sich auf proprietäre Plattformen zu verlassen. Offene und zuverlässige Zahlungssysteme ermöglichen kreative Formen des Crowdfunding, um Gemeinschaftsgüter ohne umständliche Bürokratie zu unterstützen. Peer-to-Peer-Reputationssysteme ermächtigen die Zivilgesellschaft, Fehlinformationen zu bekämpfen, oftmals mit Humor, und gleichzeitig eine rege und offene Meinungsäußerung aufrechtzuerhalten. Und mit Investitionen, die ihrem Potenzial entsprechen, zeichnen sich vielvesprechende Zukünfte ab, weil Quantencomputer im Vergleich zu anderen technischen Leitbildern zunehmend außergewöhnlich gut zur Unterstützung von Pluralität geeignet erscheinen.

Auch wenn diese Werkzeuge den öffentlichen Sektor auf der ganzen Welt verändern können, sind sie nicht nur oder gar in erster Linie für nationalstaatliche Demokratien relevant. Vielmehr bieten sie jeder Organisation, von der Kirche bis zum Unternehmen, eine Möglichkeit, produktivere und dynamischere Zusammenarbeit zu gestalten. Unternehmen können Intrapreneurship und bereichsübergreifende Infrastrukturen schneller als je zuvor fördern. Privater und souveräner Datenaustausch bietet die Möglichkeit, Krankheiten einzudämmen und zu heilen. Mehr als je zuvor kann eine neue Medienlandschaft vertrauenswürdiger und konsensfähiger in Bezug auf wichtige Fakten sein und gleichzeitig Stimmen stärken, die von traditionellen Akteuren ausgegrenzt werden. Pluralität betrifft also nicht nur Politik und Regierungen, genauso wenig wie das Internet nicht nur für das Militär und Universitäten bestimmt war, die es ursprünglich entwickelt hatten. Vielmehr handelt es sich um ein neues technologisches Phänomen, das jeden Sektor und das Leben jedes Menschen bereichern kann, wenn wir lernen, es uns zunutze zu machen.

Aber genau wie das Internet und andere transformative Technologien wird auch Pluralität nur in dem Maße gedeihen, wie wir sie vorantreiben. Das Internet begann als ein Netzwerk, das von der Advanced Research Projects Agency des US-Verteidigungsministeriums (ARPANET) eingerichtet wurde, um mit neuen dezentralen Benutzeroberflächen zu experimentieren. Doch die Vision der ARPANET-Gründer wie JCR Licklider, die unserer sehr nahesteht, wurde nur teilweise verwirklicht, weil sie nie die öffentliche und internationale Unterstützung und die branchenübergreifenden Investitionen mobilisieren konnte, die für ihre Verwirklichung erforderlich waren. Stattdessen wurde es, wie von Licklider vorhergesagt, größtenteils von Monopolen vereinnahmt, die das Potenzial des Projekts unterdrückten. Heute haben wir die Chance, diesen Fehler zu korrigieren und eine Zukunft zu schaffen, in der unsere Technologien Ausdruck unserer höchsten Ideale sind und diese stärken, anstatt sie zu entwürdigen. Jede\*r Aktivist\*in, Künstler\*in, Technologe\*in, Bürger\*in, politische\*r Entscheidungsträger\*in und jede Organisation hat eine Schlüsselrolle auf der Reise in diese Zukunft zu spielen.

When we see “internet of things”, let’s make it an internet of beings.

When we see “virtual reality”, let’s make it a shared reality.

When we see “machine learning”, let’s make it collaborative learning.

When we see “user experience”, let’s make it about human experience.

When we hear “the singularity is near”, let us remember: the plurality is here.

    </div> Die aufsehenerregenden Konflikte zwischen Technologie und Demokratie spiegeln und verbergen zugleich eine tiefere Spannung zwischen den Richtungen, in die sich die Technologie entwickelt hat, und den Prinzipien einer demokratischen Gesellschaft. Während bestimmte Technologien, die aus der KI- und Web-3-Tradition hervorgegangen sind, ein erhebliches Potenzial haben, handelt es sich bei diesen eher um fundamental antidemokratische politische Ideologien als um Technologien, welche der Zentralisierung von Macht bzw. dem extremen Individualismus verschrieben sind.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Pluralität</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Leben in einer pluralen Welt (15 Seiten): Von der grundlegendsten physikalischen Ebene der Quantenmechanik bis hin zu den größten Höhen: "Schönheit, Wachstum, Fortschritt - all das resultiert aus der Vereinigung des Ungleichen." (Zitat Star Trek). Dies alles hängt also von der Bewahrung und Ausweitung von Diversität ab, aber auch von der Stärkung der Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit über Differenzen hinaus. Die Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie kann die dynamische Landschaft der sozialen Beziehungen abbilden und neue Verbindungen und Organisationen unterstützen, die solche Netze überspannen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Das verlorene Dao (15 Seiten): Die Idee einer Netzwerkgesellschaft, in der Individuen und soziale Gruppen dynamische Überschneidungen bilden, hat ihren Ursprung in den Theorien von Soziolog*innen, Ökonom*innen und Philosoph*innen wie Henry George, Georg Simmel und John Dewey. Diese Vision war die Grundlage dessen, was zum Internet wurde, aber nie mit philosophischer Klarheit artikuliert wurde, so dass sie in Vergessenheit geriet und von anderen Philosophien verdrängt wurde, die sich auf die Imitation menschlicher Intelligenz oder die Befreiung des Individuums von sozialen Bindungen konzentrierten. Dieses Buch will diese verlorene Vision wiederfinden, zeigen, wie sie erfolgreich war und sein kann, und einen Weg aufzeigen, wie sie weiter wachsen und sich entfalten kann.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ein Blick vom Yu Shan (20 Seiten): Taiwan liegt am Schnittpunkt der Kontinentalplatten Eurasiens und Amerikas und am ideologischen Schnittpunkt der chinesischen zentralistischen KI-Ideologie, der amerikanischen hyperkapitalistischen Ideologie und der europäischen wertebasierten Regulierungsstaaten. So wie die physische Bruchkante den höchsten Punkt Taiwans, den Yu Shan, in die Höhe getrieben hat, so haben diese ideologischen Spannungen Taiwan zur Entwicklung einer pluralistischen Synthese veranlasst, die es zum technologisch fortschrittlichsten und demokratisch aktivsten Land der Welt heranreifen ließ. In diesem Kapitel wird ein lebendiges und emotionales Porträt des Lebens in Taiwans digitaler Demokratie aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln gezeichnet: dem der Ministerin, dem eine\*r bürgerlichen Aktivist\*in, dem eine\*r gewöhnlichen, digital ungebundenen Bürger\*in, dem eine\*r Unternehmer\*in, usw. Es wird auch kurz die Geschichte der Entstehung der digitalen Demokratie Taiwans geschildert, wobei Parallelen und Kontraste zu den Verhältnissen in anderen liberal-demokratischen Ländern heute gezogen werden.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Freiheit</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Menschenrechte als Betriebssystem (5 Seiten): Genauso wie industrielle Demokratien auf dem Fundament der universellen Menschenrechte aufgebaut sind, hängen digitale Demokratien von der universellen Verteidigung der Menschenrechte im digitalen Bereich ab. Der Zugang zu diesen Fähigkeiten ist derzeit begrenzt und proprietär, was das Potenzial der Pluralität untergräbt. Jedes Kapitel in diesem Abschnitt beginnt mit einer kurzen Skizze einer Interaktion, die durch die Verwirklichung dieses Rechts ermöglicht wird.
      </li>
      <li>
        Persönlichkeit (10 Seiten): Die Rechte auf Leben, Reisen und persönliche Anerkennung sind die grundlegendsten Rechte, und dennoch werden die Identitätssysteme, die dies online ermöglichen, von einigen wenigen proprietären Plattformen kontrolliert. Dezentrale und pluralistische Identitätssysteme, die jetzt im Web 3-Raum entstehen, können eine Reihe neuer Funktionen ermöglichen, die das Internet so weit über seinen gegenwärtigen Zustand hinausführen, wie das Internet frühere Kommunikationsformen erobert hat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assoziation (10 Seiten): Soziale Netzwerke bilden die Assoziation im digitalen Zeitalter ab, während Blockchains das digitale Äquivalent zu öffentlichen Plätzen darstellen. Wenn diese durch Investitionen im öffentlichen Interesse erweitert werden können, um den Ruf und die sozialen Beziehungen, die sie vermitteln, zu bereichern, haben sie das Potenzial, die Reichweite sozialer Beziehungen weit über das heutige Maß hinaus auszudehnen und viele der Funktionen zu ersetzen, die traditionell dem anonymen Marktaustausch zugewiesen werden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Handel (5 Seiten): Mit der Beteiligung legitimer Institutionen (wie Zentralbanken, Regierungen und Banken) können digitale Währungen eine Netzwerkstruktur aufweisen, die sowohl die Vorteile der Souveränität und der Privatsphäre als auch der internationalen Interoperabilität ermöglicht und den Zahlungsverkehr sowohl vom Chaos der Kryptowährungen als auch von den ineffizienten Monopolen befreit, die derzeit den Zahlungsverkehr beherrschen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eigentum (10 Seiten): Während die grundlegenden Vermögenswerte der digitalen Welt (Daten, Berechnungen und Speicher) auf verteilten Wegen geschaffen werden, hat ein Mangel an offenen Standards für ihre sichere gemeinsame Nutzung dazu geführt, dass sich die Macht auf einige wenige große Technologieunternehmen konzentriert. Öffentliche Investitionen in die Entwicklung offener Standards für die sichere gemeinsame Nutzung in diesen Bereichen werden es der Zivilgesellschaft und der Wirtschaft erlauben, weitaus ambitionierter, effizienter und mit mehr Vertrauen, Datenschutz und Souveränität zusammenzuarbeiten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zugang und Bildung (5 Seiten): Online-Menschenrechte sind nur für diejenigen relevant, die Zugang zum Cyberspace haben und sich darin bewegen können. Zugang zu Hochgeschwindigkeits-Breitbandanschlüssen und digitale Kompetenz, nicht nur Lese- und Schreibkenntnisse, müssen daher zu den universellen Menschenrechten gehören.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Demokratie</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Demokratie als Anwendungen (10 Seiten): Demokratische Institutionen sind Anwendungen, die auf diesen Grundlagen laufen können und drei grundlegende Komponenten haben: Deliberation, Kompromiss und Pluralismus. Diese Institutionen können nicht nur den öffentlichen Sektor umgestalten, sondern auch den privaten Sektor, indem sie die Wirtschaft demokratisieren und ihrerseits von solchen demokratisierten Finanzierungsmodellen abhängen. Jedes Kapitel beginnt mit einer kurzen Darstellung, wie Technologien heute eingesetzt werden, um digitale Demokratie zu realisieren.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliberation (5 Seiten): Fortschritte in der Statistik (oft verbunden mit künstlicher Intelligenz) ermöglichen ein "breites Zuhören", bei dem Millionen von Menschen die destillierte Essenz der Meinungsverteilung ihrer Mitmenschen hören können, was demokratische Deliberation auf breiter Ebene befähigt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kompromiss (5 Seiten): Fortschritte in Mechanismus-Design-Theorie (die oft mit Web3 in Verbindung gebracht werden) ermöglichen Kompromisse und Kuhhandel in großem Maßstab und erlauben direkte Demokratie, die nicht in die Fallen der Tyrannei der Mehrheit tappt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pluralismus (5 Seiten): Soziale Netzwerke geben uns die Möglichkeit, soziale Klüfte und Spaltungen zu erkennen und "lokale" Gemeinschaften zur Selbstverwaltung zu befähigen und aktiv Anreize zur Überbrückung dieser Klüfte zu schaffen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finanzen (5 Seiten): Neue Formen der sozialen Organisation, die aus der Web3-Gemeinschaft hervorgehen, ermöglichen es uns, die Kluft zwischen Markt und Staat zu überwinden, indem wir einen aufstrebenden sozialen Sektor schaffen, der demokratische Dienstleistungen in großem Umfang anbieten kann.

    </div> Demokratie hat in weiten Teilen der Welt einen schlechten Ruf, weil sie bei der Bewältigung wichtiger globaler Herausforderungen versagt. Das liegt daran, dass sie nicht mit der Technologie Schritt gehalten hat; wenn sie es doch tut, zeigt die Erfahrung Taiwans, dass sie autoritäre Regime übertrumpfen kann. In jedem Kapitel werden Statistiken vorgestellt, die den Erfolg von Ländern wie Taiwan und Estland veranschaulichen, die die digitale Demokratie verwirklicht haben.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Medien (5 Seiten): Fehlinformationen können eingedämmt werden, ohne die Meinungsfreiheit zu beeinträchtigen, wenn Algorithmen Inhalte mit überraschendem Konsens an die Oberfläche bringen und zivilgesellschaftliche Gruppen aktiv mitwirken, die sich des Humors bedienen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gesundheit (5 Seiten): Pandemien und andere Krisensituationen im Bereich der öffentlichen Gesundheit können rechtzeitig erkannt und mit minimalen wirtschaftlichen Kosten bewältigt werden, wenn die Zivilgesellschaft in der Lage ist, umgehend Systeme für die Zuteilung knapper Gesundheitsressourcen zu entwickeln und Ansteckungsketten zu bekämpfen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Umwelt (5 Seiten): Umweltschäden, von der lokalen bis zur globalen Ebene, können schnell und ohne Eingriff in die Privatsphäre identifiziert werden, wenn Bürger*innen horizontale "Datenkoalitionen" bilden, die mit Regierungen verhandeln können, damit diese ihrer Verantwortung gerecht werden und sicherstellen, dass Gesellschaftsmitglieder dasselbe tun.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arbeitsplätze (5 Seiten): Nicht durch den Ersatz, sondern durch die Einbeziehung von Menschen in digitale Technologien können diese bessere Arbeitsplätze schaffen als sie verdrängen, und so zu einem natürlichen Wohlstand und gesellschaftlichen Mitwirkung führen.

        Institutionen (20 Seiten): Die zur Verwirklichung der Pluralität erforderlichen umfangreichen Investitionen erfordern die Zusammenführung von Finanzierungsquellen aus einer Vielzahl von Sektoren und Ländern, um die Motive des nationalen Interesses, des Profits und der Wohltätigkeit zu kombinieren und zu transzendieren. Experimente mit verschiedenen Gemeinschaften an vielen geografischen Standorten müssen eng mit der Standardisierung verknüpft werden, die einen internationalen Maßstab erreichen kann, indem ein Netzwerk von digitalen Minister\*innen wie in Taiwan genutzt wird. Unternehmen des privaten Sektors, akademische Einrichtungen, Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen und Aktivist\*innen müssen sich an Beiträgen orientieren, die vom Prestige und den Zukunftsvisionen angezogen werden, welche die Mitarbeit an der Zukunft offener Standards mit sich bringt. Dieser Plan ist zwar ambitioniert, erweitert aber die Geschichte des Internets, die durch das von der Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET) finanzierte Netzwerk von Nutzerforschungslabors angestoßen wurde, auf unsere heutige multipolare Welt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Handlung (10 Seiten): Während der Erfolg Koordination auf höchster Ebene erfordert, hat jede\*r Bürger\*in eine Aufgabe zu erfüllen, um das Momentum zu schaffen, das dieses Vorhaben in Gang bringt. Wir werden zeigen, wie Hacker\*innen, Investor\*innen, Geschäftsleute, Aktivist\*innen, Künstler\*innen und Wähler\*innen Teil einer Bewegung sein können, die dafür sorgt, dass unsere Technologien unseren Werten dienen, anstatt von ihnen diktiert zu werden.

多元宇宙：數位協作與民主的科技典範

由唐鳳及格倫·韋爾著作

內文介紹並尋求各界協作

*Chinese translation by Noah Yeh, Jacky Wang, Vivian Chen, Isabel Hou, Elena Chen, Gisele Chou, KC Chen, Stamford Hwang*

我們即將迎來一趟新的旅程，希望各位可以加入我們。過往五年裡，我們與你們中的許多人一起協作，希望為聚焦於金融化與中心化 AI 主導的未來科技方向，發展出替代敘事。

**多元宇宙（Plurality）**，是運用認同、尊重並賦能共同協作的科技，來跨越社會與文化差異。接下來的概述，會更清楚的描繪這個概念。

我們認為，多元宇宙是為了支持民主社會持續繁榮，並能跨越當今世界高壁深塹的分裂，所自然產生的新科技典範。我們希望告訴世界這個新的可能性，以此激勵多樣化、跨領域的協調、投資及實驗，讓願景成為現實。為此，我們需要你的幫助。

我們的計劃，會與多元宇宙的研究及實作一起演進。我們將書內的概念直接運用在本書的創作、發行及金援上。所有的素材都是「自由文化作品」，採用最寬鬆的創用 CC 授權。我們計畫公開運用分散式版本管理的方式來撰寫這本書，也將從社群徵求編輯及研究助手，並募集貢獻者，來幫助我們排列分支版本的優先合併順序，並決定接下來成書的內容。我們會運用各種 web3 原生機制來進行財務支援並對齊貢獻者們的動機，包括多元/平方募資法、實體及數位書籍的 NFT「簽名」、或透過 SALSA/Harberger NFT 賦能格倫作為演講者或是顧問的邀請權利等。我們會用靈魂綁定代幣（SBT）來定義貢獻者的角色，也會將未來實體發行後的治理機制，包括募資的資金分發，並建立在這個基礎上，將書籍的貢獻社群轉化為分散式自治組織（DAO）。我們會與 Protocol Labs（PL）合作打造此模式的科技基底，也希望創造在 web3 發行內容的嶄新模式。

我們倡導多元，因此不只希望接觸到 「web3 原生社群」，更希望本書可以成為一份美麗的實體物件，在傳統的媒體及發行場域中也能廣泛被接受、發行及反饋。我們不只需要黑客與作家，我們也需要設計師、說故事的人、行銷人及發行商來跟我們合作。我們同時也理解這些合作單位可能會偏好某些獨家權利，多過於未來現金流的治理權。對於擁有共同目標及願景的夥伴，我們在協商時會開放迎接各種可能性。但在任何情況下，唐鳳、格倫為本書撰寫文字，都不會收取任何報酬或是版稅，以符合伴隨他們職位的法律規範；營收只會用來支持我們盼望建立的社群與公益使命。

我們很快會將開放寫作及參與管理的平台公諸於世。如果你想要提前貢獻，[請寫信到 Glen](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org)。如果我們能共同想像及解釋，科技的未來就有可能認同也支持我們所珍惜的價值。

<h2>概述</h2>

技術與民主處於分裂狀態：技術加強威權監督並腐蝕民主機構，而民主國家則以限制性監管和公共部門的保守主義進行反擊。然而，這種衝突並非不可避免。這是我們選擇投資於 AI 和加密貨幣等技術，而忽視民主原則的後果。一些地方，例如以太坊社群、愛沙尼亞、科羅拉多州，尤其是台灣，轉而專注於促進多元協作的技術，並見證了民主和技術的共同繁榮。這本書由多元宇宙的範式領導者撰寫，首次展示了每位技術專家、政策制定者、商業領袖和活動家，如何利用它來建立一個更加協作、多樣化和富有成效的民主世界。

當優步到達台灣時，引發了許多爭議，如同於世界大多地區一般。但在數位閣員參與開發的 vTaiwan 平台協助下，社交媒體並沒有在爭議上火上澆油，而是鼓勵公民分享感受，跟數千名參與者深度對話，集思廣益如何監管線上叫車服務。這項技術，運用通常與 AI 關聯的統計工具來聚集意見，讓每位參與者都能快速吸收全民觀點的最清晰表述，並回饋自己的想法。在起初不同觀點的分群當中，能獲取廣泛支持的意見浮上水面，形成粗略的共識，確保新式乘車工具的好處，同時也保護司機的權益，並由政府實施。這套程序曾被台灣用於解決數十個有爭議的問題，並迅速傳播到全球政府、合作社和區塊鏈社群。

然而，對於技術如何可被設計應用於感知尊重、並促進跨越社會差異協作，vTaiwan 平台僅僅是最初步的嘗試。以太坊生態圈發展出的新興投票和金融機制，將重新塑造我們治理公、私部門的方式；沈浸式的虛擬世界，也將為原本社會中互斥的力量，創造彼此同理的連結；社群網絡和新聞資訊有機會被打造成凝聚社會、創造共識的平台，而非讓人們漸行漸遠。如同台灣經驗所示，這些技術有可能創造極大的社會效益，包括領先全球的危機處理機制，從 Covid 疫情，到因應爭議訊息的傳布，從而創造更廣泛的共榮願景。

儘管已經有不少國家和生態系，投入數千萬美金的資源進入相關的研發，世界上其他地方則將數千億美金的資源，投入 AI 和加密貨幣等技術發展，兩種資源挹注的方式，與我們所追求的目標有著根本的差異。讓社會邁向全自動化的 AI 目標，會產生出遠離人類參與、權力中央化、強化專制制度、還有削弱中產階級的力量。投機的加密貨幣、具有高度成癮性的社群媒體、和逃避現實的所謂「元宇宙」都在在破壞了社會結構、加速社會分裂、讓爭議訊息成了疫情般的存在、也激化了犯罪行為。不意外地，投資了這些技術方向的國家，也因而將民主制度和數位科技視為對頭。

但現在要調整方向還不算太遲：我們投入的技術方向，可以幫助數位人權發展、促進多元價值。這些願景可以在民主社會裡成長茁壯，超越威權主義和極端資本主義。從每個人不可剝奪的數位世界人權出發，我們可以投入新世代的去中心化身份技術，來賦予每個人旅行、交易、從商和參與民主社群的機會，不被中心化的監控體系把持。我們可以實踐數位世界中的結社自由，透過社群共同管理、負責任的社會網絡和帳本，建構未來世界的市政廳和公民廣場，將逐漸分歧出多元觀點的社群連結起來。我們可以透過創造未來世界的公共市集和百貨大街，來保障數位財產權，運用加密技術來增進端對端的數據共享、運算和儲存的安全和隱私性，不再被壟斷市場的平台控制。我們可以讓人們擁有從商的權力，運用政府支持、保障隱私且國際通用的數位貨幣。我們還可以讓取用高速網路成為基本人權，並確保國民教育納入數位素養課程，增進全體公民的權益。

保障基礎的數位人權，讓多元主義在數位世界成為不只是可能，而是自然的存在。在台灣，”Digital” 與 “Plural” 都可以寫作「數位」。台灣經驗展現了，即便這些基礎僅在初期的生態系統中，也正在推動民主的繁榮。以 vTaiwan 為例，安全而且隱私的個人身份，讓公民在免受網路機器人的攻擊下，進行思考周全的對談與合理的妥協。重視隱私的資料分享，讓社群可以在不依賴大型平台的情況下提供服務（從汙染監控到口罩地圖）。開放且可靠的支付方式，讓具有創意的共有財群眾集資，擺脫繁文縟節的拘束。點對點的聲譽系統，讓公民社會在維持開放且充滿活力的對話下，可以因應爭議訊息，不時還能參雜些幽默。

此外，雖然這些技術可以促進全球的公部門轉型，但應用範圍遠遠不止國家層級的民主治理。它們對於各種組織，從教會到公司，都提供了促進更有成效的動態合作方式。 公司可以更容易促進內部創業，以及建構跨部門的基礎建設。個人自主的數據共享，可以防制和治療疾病。新的媒體環境，可以在關鍵事實上更值得信賴和達成共識，同時賦予被傳統守門者邊緣化的聲音。因此，多元宇宙並不只適用於政治和政府，就像網際網路不只適用於最早建立它的軍隊和大學。相反，它是一種新的技術典範，如果我們學會如何利用，它可以改善每個部門和每個人的生活。

但就像網際網路和其他變革技術一樣，多元宇宙的蓬勃發展，取決於我們投入多少心力。網際網路，最初是由美國國防高等研究計劃署 (ARPANET) 用於試驗新的分散式用戶界面設計，所建立的網路。我們的構想與 ARPANET 先驅約瑟夫·利克萊德的願景非常接近，但因為當時並未動員公眾和國際支持，以及實現願景所需的跨部門投資，所以只有少部分被實現了。相反的，正如利克萊德預測的那樣，網際網路的許多潛力，目前正被壟斷限制。今天，我們有機會糾正這個錯誤、建立新的未來，讓技術支持我們的最高理想，而不是貶低它們**。**每位行動家、藝術家、科技人、公民、政策制定者和組織，都在爭取未來的奮鬥中扮演關鍵角色。

        多元宇宙的生活（15頁）：從量子力學中最基礎的實體級到雄偉的高峰，「美妙、成長、進步——都是由毫不相似之事物連結、碰撞萌生。」（出自《星艦迷航記》）因此我們需要維護並鼓勵多樣性，並強化跨越岐異的溝通與合作。資訊和傳播科技，有助於規劃出社會關係間的互動模式，並促進這些跨網絡間的關係和組織。
      </li>
      <li>
        失落的 DAO （15頁）：網絡社會的概念為個人和社會團體間的相互作用，此概念源自於社會學家、經濟學家、和哲學家亨利・喬治、齊美爾、和約翰・杜威提出的理論。它奠定了現代網際網路的基礎，但其中的哲學卻從未被明確闡述過，因此逐漸被遺忘且被其他模仿人類智慧和個人脫離社會束縛的理論取代。本書期望能夠找回被遺忘的願景，證明其過去的成就，並開拓未來的道路。
      </li>
      <li>
        玉山視野（20頁）：台灣坐落於歐亞板塊和美洲板塊的交界處，也是中共集權主義的 AI 意識形態、美式資本主義、以及歐洲價值型管理意識形態的十字路口。板塊間的斷層線將台灣的最高峰——玉山不斷往上推擠，這些不同文化間的思維衝撞，也讓台灣發展出多元的綜合觀點，並成為世界上科技最先進、民主最活躍的國家。本章將從多個角度，生動而感性地描繪台灣數位民主的日常：閣員、公民活動家、普通公民、商人等等。我們將簡要講述台灣數位民主如何出現的歷史，與當今其他自由民主國家的情況進行類比和對比。

        人權即作業系統（5頁）：正如工業民主國家建立在基本人權的基礎上，數位民主需仰賴人們共同努力捍衛數位人權。在現有的框架下，只能用有限和私營的方式取得這些權利，多元宇宙也就因此無法發揮潛力。這部分每個章節的開頭都會簡短地描繪出實現數位人權能夠帶來的效應。
      </li>
      <li>
        生而為人（10頁）：生命權、人身自由、和自我認同都是人類最基礎的權利。但網際網路上實現這些權利的身分認證系統，目前被少數平台控制住了。在 web3 上出現的去中心化和多元身分認證系統，能夠開啟一系列新的功能，讓網際網路再次顛覆故有的溝通模式。
      </li>
      <li>
        連結（10頁）社交網絡映現數位時代中的連結，而區塊鏈提供了公共廣場的數位代用品。 如果這些可以通過公利投資來擴展，進而豐富它們所傳達的聲譽和社會關係，那麼就有潛力將社會關係的範圍擴展遠較現有廣泛的範圍，並取代許多傳統上由匿名市場交換提供的功能。
      </li>
      <li>
        商業（5頁）在合法機構（如各國央行、政府和銀行）參與下，數位貨幣能實現同時享有：主權、隱私以及國際互通性利益的網絡結構，也可以將支付同時從「加密貨幣的混亂」和「當前主流支付的低效率壟斷」中解放出來。
      </li>
      <li>
        財產（10頁）雖然數位世界的基本資產（資料、運算能力和記憶體）是以分散式方式建立的，但缺乏安全共享的開放標準致使權力集中在一些大型科技公司。 在這些領域制定開放共用標準的公共投資，將使民間社會和商業團體能夠實現更大規模、更有效率的合作，兼顧信任、隱私和自主。
      </li>
      <li>
        近用和教育（5 頁） 數位人權，僅與那些能進入網路空間的人相關。因此，寬頻接取和數位素養（不僅是識讀），必須是普世人權。

      <li>
        民主即應用程式（10頁）民主制度是可以在這些基礎上運行的應用程式，具有三個基本要件：審議、折衷和多元。 這些機制不僅可以改造公部門、還可以改變私部門，促使商業民主化，並運用民主方式進行募資。

新しい著作の紹介と協力者の募集

Plurality: 協働可能な多様性と民主主義のためのテクノロジー

オードリー・タン、グレン・ワイル

*Japanese translation by Akinori Oyama, tkgshn*

私たちは長い旅に出ようとしています。皆さんもご一緒しませんか。5年間以上に渡り、私たちは多くの皆さんと協力して、金融化や中央集権的な人工知能に焦点を当てたテクノロジーの未来についての通常の物語の語られ方に代わるものを発展させてきました。 「Plurality（複数・多次元性）」と私たちが呼んでいるものは、社会的および文化的な違いを超えた協力を認識し、尊重し、力を与えるテクノロジーです。Pluralityについては、この案内に続く概要の章を読むと、より深く理解していただけると思います。私たちは、「「Plurality」が民主主義社会の繁栄を支えるためには自然に導き出される技術的パラダイムであり、今日の世界に定着した多くの分断を克服できると信じています。私たちはこの可能性を世界に伝え、それを実現するための多様で協調的な投資と実験的な試みを促せるようにしたいと考えています。そして、私たちはあなたにも手伝ってほしいのです。

私たちの計画は、”Pluralityそのもの”に関する研究と、社会実装の実情の両方によって発展していきますが、私たちは、本を作り、、届け、、それらを金銭的に支えていく方法においても、本に記すのと同じように、体現できるようにしてことを約束します。すべての素材は、クリエイティブ・コモンズ・ライセンスの最も寛容なカテゴリの 1 つである「フリー・カルチャー・ワーク」になります。私たちは、この本を git の仕組みのように公開の場で執筆する予定です。つまり、コミュニティから編集や研究の協力をオープンに募り、プルリクエストの優先順位付けを支援して結果として本の内容を調整管理するために貢献してくれる人を募る予定です。私たちは、Plural/Quadratic Funding (通例QF、二次資金調達)形式での助成金や、物理的およびデジタル的に購入された書籍のコピーに対する NFT「署名」や、本に関する講演者やコンサルタントとしてグレン・ワイルへの依頼手段としてのSALSA/Harberger NFT など、さまざまな相応しいWeb3 ネイティブのメカニズムの数々を使用して、本を利用できるようにするための財政的費用をサポートします。私たちは、Soulbound Tokens (SBT) をこの本の出版に関するさまざまな貢献に応じて付与し、出版（完成）したあと、”それらをどう進めていくか”に関しての決定を最終的にはDAOに委ねていく予定です。これに関しては、出版作業そのもののために集めたお金（雇用も含む）のほか、売り上げの配分などもどのように行うかも含まれます。私たちは Protocol Labs (PL) と緊密に連携して、これらを実現するための技術基盤を構築し、Web3時代の新しい出版モデルの発明に役立つことを願っています。

同時に、私たちはPlurality 主義者として、「Web 3 ネイティブ」な人たちだけに届けたいわけでありません。そのため、この著作を物理的な作品としても、標準的な出版およびメディア流通経路でも幅広い範囲で配布され、レビューされ、読まれる美しい物理的作品にしたいと考えています。したがって、ハッカーやライターだけではなく、デザイナー、ストーリーテラー、マーケター、翻訳者、出版社などにも協力していただく必要があります。“今のうちにこれに貢献しておけば、今後ソーシャルキャピタルを含めた資産が手に入るかもしれない”という人がいる反面、より個人的な利益・権利を求める人がいることも理解しています。このため場合によっては、私たちの目標やビジョンをはじめ、他の側面でも同じような考えを持つ方々と連携する交渉も受け付けます。いずれにせよ、この呼びかけをしているオードリー・タンもグレン・ワイルも、著作する文章の貢献に対する報酬やロイヤルティを受け取ることはありません。こうする目的は、わたしたちそれぞれが雇用に関連する法的責任を遵守し、私たちの使命と私たちが構築したいと考えているコミュニティを収益が支えていけることを保証するためです。

私たちは、公の場での執筆と参加の管理を可能にするソフトウェアで実現される基盤をまもなく公開しますが、それ以前に貢献したい方法を思いついた場合には、[どうか Glen 宛にお知らせください。](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org)私たちが協力してテクノロジーを想像し説明することで、テクノロジーの未来は、私たちが大切にしている価値を尊重し可能にするものになれます。

<h2>概要</h2>

テクノロジーと民主主義は戦争状態にあります。テクノロジーは権威主義的な監視を強化し、民主主義制度を侵食しています。一方、民主主義は制約的な規制と公共部門の保守主義で反撃しています。この対立は避けられません。その中で、人工知能 (AI) や暗号通貨などの反民主的なテクノロジーに投資することを、私たちは選択してきました。その一方で、イーサリアム コミュニティ、エストニア、コロラド州、特に台湾などのいくつかの場所では、代わりに、多様な協働を可能にするテクノロジーに集中しており、民主主義とテクノロジーが共に繁栄するのが見られました。このPluralityの新しいパラダイムのリーダー集団によるこの本は、技術者、政策立案者、ビジネス リーダー、活動家のすべての人たちがPluralityを利用して、より協力的で多様で生産的な民主主義の世界を構築する方法を初めて示すものです。

Uber が台湾に上陸したとき、世界の多くの地域と同様に、その存在は対立の種となるものでした。しかし、ソーシャル メディアによってこの炎上に油が注がれたのではなく、大臣でもある私たちの 1 人が仲間と一緒に開発した vTaiwan プラットフォームを用いることで、市民が意見を出し合うことを可能にしました。配車サービスをどのように規制すべきかについて、この問題について意見を持つ市民が何千人もの参加者と思慮深く熟慮した会話を行いました。ここでのテクノロジーは、AI としばしば同じと連想される統計ツールが意見をクラスターにまとめるものでした。これにより、議論への参加者すべてが、対等な立場の市民が出した視点を、最も明確な形で表現されることで消化できるようにして、参加者が自分自身の考えを洗練できるようにしました。当初の分断されたそれぞれの考えを越えて支持を集めた意見は最も大切なこととして掲げられ、労働者の権利を保護しながらも新しい配車ツールの利点も保証するような大まかな合意が形成され、政府によって法整備が実施されました。この仕組みは、台湾では他にも論争の的となっている何十もの問題を解決するために使用されていて、世界中の政府、協同組合、ブロックチェーン コミュニティに急速に広がっています。

しかし、vTaiwan は、協働の仕組みとして社会での違いの認識、尊重、橋渡しを、テクノロジーで解決するように設計できることのほんの表面をなぞったにすぎません。イーサリアムのエコシステムから生まれた新しい投票と資金調達のルールは、公共部門と民間部門を管理する方法を再形成する可能性があります。他にも、没入型の仮想世界は、社会的に排除された括りを越えて共感的なつながりを可能にしています。ソーシャルネットワークとニュースフィードは、私たちを引き離すのではなく、社会的結束と共有された意味付与を築くように設計できます。そして、台湾の経験が示しているように、潜在的な社会的利益は膨大で、新型コロナウィルスのパンデミックを始め、誤った情報からの混乱などの近年のさまざまな危機への対応に留まらず、広く共有された繁栄の創出にも、世界で最も優れた対応を可能にしています。

しかし、少数の国やエコシステムがそのような技術に数千万ドルを投入している一方で、それ以外では世界中で、AI と暗号に数千億ドルを投入しています。ここでは 根本的に異なる目標が追求されています。AI の目標は、自動化によって人間が参加できないようにし、権力を集中化し、専制政治を強化し、中産階級を弱体化させることを目指すものです。投機的な暗号通貨、中毒性のあるソーシャル メディア、現実逃避的な「メタバース」は、社会構造を弱体化させ、社会的分断を強化し、インフォデミックを広め、犯罪を増加させてきました。したがって、これらのテクノロジーに投資した国々が民主主義とテクノロジーを敵と見なしていることは驚くに値しません。さらに、これらのアプローチは、社会構造だけでなく、量子的性質がPluralismの提唱者の原則に基づいていることが近年示されている物理的宇宙の基本構造に対しても、生態学的多様性に満ちた私たちの生きている地球に対しても害をなしています。

しかし、進む道を変えるのに遅すぎるということはありません。私たちは、デジタル上の人権を確立し、Pluralismを強化し、民主主義社会を繁栄することの全てを実現できるテクノロジーに投資するようになることも可能です。これによって、権威主義や超資本主義を凌ぐことができます。私たちは、すべての人が中央集権的な監視から解放されて、旅行、取引、事業を行い、民主的なコミュニティに参加できるようにするような、新世代の分散型アイデンティティ (DID) テクノロジーを使用して、不可分で部分的に譲渡させられることのないデジタル上の法律的人格の権利をすべての人に与えるために投資することができます。私たちは、コミュニティによって管理されるような説明責任のあるソーシャル ネットワークと分散型台帳をデジタルの世界の形で、団体結成の自由を実現できます。これらのソーシャル ネットワークと台帳は、将来のタウンホール型の対話の場や公共の場を形成し、グループ間で増大する分断を橋渡しします。プラットフォームの独占者の支配のない状態になり、当事者間でのデータ、計算、およびストレージを安全かつプライバシーを保護して共有するための暗号化技術を使用する将来の金融産業と将来の金融以外の産業を作成することにより、デジタル財産権を確保できます。政府が認識している、プライバシーを保護し、国際的に相互運用可能なデジタル通貨を使用して、取引する権利を確保できます。また、高速インターネットを基本的な人権に指定し、デジタルの理解に留まらず協働的に創造できる能力の教育を公立学校のカリキュラムの中核にすることで、すべての市民がこれらの権利にアクセスできるようにすることができます。

これらの基本的なデジタル人権を確保することで、デジタル世界でのPluralismが可能になるだけでなく、自然に持っているものにできます。台湾では、「デジタル」と「複数」の表意文字は同じで、數位です。そこでの経験や同様のエコシステムでの経験は、これらの基盤が、初期の形であっても、繁栄する民主主義をどのように促進するかを示しています。プライベートで安全な ID により、市民は vTaiwan のように、ネット荒らしや自動応答ボットからの攻撃に直面することなく、思慮深い審議と合理的な妥協案の作成に参加できます。プライベートなデータ共有により、特定企業独自のプラットフォームに依存することなく、地域やコミュニティがサービス (汚染の監視からマスク在庫を表示する地図まで)を提供できます。オープンで信頼性の高い支払の仕組みにより、手間のかかる官僚機構なしで共有財を支援するための創造的な形のクラウドファンディングが可能になります。ピアツーピアの評判情報システムにより、市民社会は活気に満ちたオープンな発言を維持しながら、多くの場合ユーモアを交えて誤報と闘うことができます。そして、その可能性に見合った投資を行うことで、より大胆な未来が間近に迫っており、量子コンピューターが他の技術パラダイムと比較してPluralismを可能にするのに非常に適していることがますます明らかになっています。

さらに、これらのツールは世界中の公共部門を変革することができますが、国家民主主義に一時的に妥当なだけでなく、教会から企業まで、あらゆる組織がより生産的でダイナミックな協力を促進する方法を提供します。企業は、かつてないほどに迅速に社内起業や部門間基礎的な基盤を強化できます。プライベートで主権のあるデータ共有は、病気を封じ込め、治療することができます。新しい報道等のメディア環境は、従来なら情報開示を妨げる門番によって疎外されてきた声に力を与えると同時に、これまで以上に重要な事実についての信頼性を高め、妥当と同意しやすいものにできます。このように、Pluralityは政治や政府のためだけのものではなく、インターネットも最初にそれを構築した軍や大学のためだけのものに過ぎなかったですが、それを活用する方法を学べば、すべての産業とすべての個人の生活をより良く変えることができる新しい技術パラダイムです。

しかし、インターネットやその他の革新的であり方を変えるようなテクノロジーと同様に、Pluralityは、私たちが投資した分だけしか繁栄しません。インターネットは、米国国防総省の高等研究計画局 (ARPANET) が新しい分散型ユーザーインターフェースの設計を実験するために設立したネットワークとして始まりました。しかし、J.C.リックライダー(JCR Licklider)のようなARPANET の創設者のビジョンは、私たちも今回のPluralityを同様の構想に基づいて構想設計していますが、それを実行するために必要な公的および国際的な支援と多機関による投資を動員しなかったため、非常に部分的にしか実現されませんでした。構想が実現せずに、リックライダーが予測したように、その可能性を妨げた独占企業によって多くの可能性が占有されてしまいました。今日、今こそ、私たちはその過ちを正し、私たちのテクノロジーが私たちの最高の理想を劣化させるのではなく、その理想を明らかにし、また、実現するような未来を築く機会です。すべての活動家、アーティスト、技術者、市民、政策立案者、組織は、その未来のための闘いにおいて重要な役割を担っています。

<div class="markdown markdown-sm italic text-center mt-12 mb-12">

When we see “internet of things”, let’s make it an internet of beings.

When we see “virtual reality”, let’s make it a shared reality.

When we see “machine learning”, let’s make it collaborative learning.

When we see “user experience”, let’s make it about human experience.

When we hear “the singularity is near”, let us remember: the plurality is here.

      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Introduction: The War Between Democracy and Technology</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(10 pages):</p>
    </div> The headline-grabbing conflicts between tech and democracy at once reflect and conceal a deeper tension between the directions technology has developed and the principles of a democratic society. While specific technologies that have come out of the AI and web3 traditions have significant potential, they are fundamentally anti-democratic political ideologies rather than technologies, committed to the centralization of power and extreme individualism respectively.
  </li>

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Plurality</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Living in a Plural World (15 pages): From the most basic physical level of quantum mechanics to the greatest heights, “beauty, growth, progress – all result from the union of the unlike.” (Star Trek quote). These all therefore depend on maintaining and proliferating diversity, while also strengthening communication and cooperation across difference. Information and communications technology can map the dynamic landscape of social relationships and facilitate new connections and organizations that span such networks.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Lost Dao (15 pages) The idea of a network society, where individuals and social groups are both dynamic intersections of each other, originated in the theories of sociologists, economists and philosophers like Henry George, Georg Simmel and John Dewey. This vision was the foundation of what become the internet, but was never articulated with philosophical clarity, allowing it to be forgotten and superseded by other philosophies, focused on imitation of human intelligence or the liberation of individuals from social bonds. This book aims to recover that lost vision, show how it has and can succeed and chart a path forward for it to flourish.
      </li>
      <li>
        A View from Yu Shan (20 pages) Taiwan sits at the intersection of the continental plates of Eurasia and America, and at the ideological intersection of the Chinese centralized AI ideology, the American hyper-capitalist ideology and European values-based regulatory states. As the physical fault line has pushed the highest point in Taiwan, Yu Shan, higher, so too these ideological tensions have pushed Taiwan to develop a pluralist synthesis that allowed it to become the most technologically advanced and most actively democratic country in the world. This chapter will give a vivid and emotive portrait of the life in Taiwan’s digital democracy from multiple vantage points: that of the minister, that of a civic activist, that of an ordinary digitally disengaged citizen, that of a businessperson, etc. It will also briefly tell the history of how Taiwan’s digital democracy emerged, drawing parallels and contrasts to the circumstances of other liberal democratic countries today.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Freedom</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Human Rights as an Operating System (5 pages) Just as industrial democracies are built on the foundation of universal human rights, digital democracies depend on the universal defense of human rights in the digital realm. Access to these capabilities is currently limited and proprietary, undermining the potential of Plurality. Each chapter in this section will begin with a short sketch of an interaction that the realization of this right will enable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personhood (10 pages) The rights to life, travel and personal recognition are the most fundamental of rights and yet the identity systems that make these possible online are controlled by a few proprietary platforms. Decentralized and pluralistic identity systems that are now emerging from the web3 space can empower a range of new functionalities that take the internet as far beyond its current state as the internet took prior modes of communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Association (10 pages) Social networks map association in the digital age, while blockchains provide the digital equivalent of public squares. If these can be extended by public-interested investment to enrich the reputation and social relationships these convey, they have the potential to extend the reach of social relationships far broader beyond today and substitute for many of the functions traditionally assigned to anonymous market exchange.
      </li>
      <li>
        Commerce (5 pages) With the participation of legitimate institutions (such as central banks, governments and banks), digital currencies can have a network structure that allows both the benefits of sovereignty and privacy and of international interoperability, freeing payments both from the chaos of cryptocurrencies and the inefficient monopolies that currently dominate payments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Property (10 pages) While the fundamental assets of the digital world (data, computation and memory) are created in a distributed manner, the lack of open standards for securely sharing them has concentrated power in a few big tech companies. Public investment in developing open standards for secure sharing in these areas will allow civil society and business groups to achieve far more ambitious collaboration, more efficiently, with greater trust, privacy, and sovereignty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Access and education (5 pages) Online human rights are only relevant to those who can access and navigate cyberspace. High speed broadband access and digital competence, not just literacy, education must therefore be universal human rights.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Democracy</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Democracy as Applications (10 pages) Democratic institutions are applications that can run on these foundations and have three fundamental components: deliberation, compromise and pluralism. These institutions can not only transform the public sector but also the private sector, democratizing business, and depend in turn on such democratized financing models. Each chapter will begin with a vignette of ways technologies are being used today to achieve digital democracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliberation (5 pages) Advances in statistics (often associated with AI) make it possible “broad listening”, where millions of people can hear the distilled essence of the distribution of opinion of their peers, empowering democratic deliberation at scale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compromise (5 pages) Advances in mechanism design (often associated with web3) make compromise and horse-trading at scale possible, allowing direct democracy that doesn’t fall into the traps of tyranny of the majority.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pluralism (5 pages) Social networks allow us to trace social cleavages and divisions, allowing us to both empower “local” communities to self-govern and to actively create incentives for bridging these divides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finance (5 pages) New forms of social organization emerging from the web3 community allow us to transcend the market-state divide by creating an emergent social sector that can provide democratic services at scale.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <li>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5em">
      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Impact</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(Intro 5 pages):</p>
    </div> Democracy has gotten a bad reputation in much of the world for failing to deliver on critical global challenges. This is because it hasn’t kept pace with technology; when it does, Taiwan’s experience shows it can outperform authoritarian regime. Each chapter will highlight statistics illustrating the success possible in countries like Taiwan and Estonia that have made digital democracy a reality.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Media (5 pages) Misinformation can be contained while maintaining vibrant free speech with algorithms that surface content with surprising consensus and active participation of civil society groups that harness humor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Health (5 pages) Pandemics and other public health crises can be identified and responded with agility and minimal economic costs if civil society can rapidly design systems for allocating scarce health resources and targeting chains of transmission.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment (5 pages) Environmental harms, from the local to the global, can quickly be identified without invading privacy if citizens can form horizontal “data coalitions” that can bargain with governments to live up to their responsibilities and ensure community members do the same.

        Institutions (20 pages) The large-scale investment necessary to realize Plurality will require fusing together funding sources from a variety of sectors and countries to combine and transcend the motives of national interest, profit and charity. Experimentation with diverse communities across many geographic locations will have to closely tie to the standardization that can achieve international scale, harnessing a network of digital ministers like that in Taiwan. Private sector businesses, academic institutions, charitable organizations, and activists will all have to be drawn into contributions lured by the prestige and vision of the future that comes with contributing to the future of open standards. While ambitious, this plan largely extends the history of the internet stimulated by the network of user research laboratories funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET), extending it to our current multipolar world.

        Action (10 pages) While success will require coordination at the highest levels, every citizen has a role to play to build the momentum to make this possible. We will show how hackers, investors, businesspeople, activists, artists, voters all can be part of a movement to make our tools serve our values rather than be dictated by them.

Приглашаем к сотрудничеству по созданию книги

Плюральность: технология коллективного разнообразия и демократии

Одри Тенг и Е. Глен Вайл

Мы начинаем свое путешествие, и надеемся, что вы присоединитесь.  На протяжении последней половины декады, мы, в сотрудничестве с многими из вас, разрабатывали альтернативу стандартным рассказам о будущем технологий, которые сосредоточены на растущей роли финансового сектора или централизованном искусственном интеллекте.  *Плюральность* — как мы ее называем — это технология, которая признает, отдает дань уважения и расширяет возможности сотрудничества, выходя за рамки социальных и культурных различий.  Вы можете узнать подробнее об этом в обзоре ниже. Мы считаем, что плюральность — это естественная технологическая парадигма, для поддержания процветания демократических обществ и способная преодолеть многие укоренившиеся разногласия в нашем мире сегодня.  Мы хотим рассказать миру об этой возможности для стимуляции разносторонних и скоординированных инвестиций и экспериментов, которые могут превратить ее в реальность.  И мы хотим вашей помощи.

В то время как наш четкий план будет меняться по мере развития исследований в области плюральности и практических реалий, мы стремимся воплощать идеи книги таким образом, как мы ее создаем, распространяем и финансово поддерживаем. Все материалы будут относиться к общедоступной культурной работе, в наиболее широкой лицензии для бесплатного распространения произведений культуры.  Мы планируем написать книгу публичным образом в git-подобной структуре, где мы будем открыто запрашивать редакционную и исследовательскую помощь от сообщества и привлекать тех, кто вносит свой вклад, чтобы помочь нам определить приоритеты запросов на включение изменений и, в конечном итоге, контролировать содержание книги. Мы будем помогать покрывать финансовые расходы для того, чтобы сделать книгу доступной, используя ряд согласованных Web3-нативных механизмов, включая гранты Плюрального/Квадратичного финансирования, «подписи» NFT на физических и цифровых копиях книги и варианты NFT SALSA/Harberger для привлечения Глена в качестве спикера/консультанта по книге.  Мы представим ряд ролей, вносящих свой вклад в книгу, используя токены Soulbound (SBT) и будем использовать их в качестве основы для управления выбором контента после публикации, включая распоряжение большей частью собранных средств, последовательно превращая сообщество книги в Распределенную автономную организацию (DAO).  Мы будем вести тесное сотрудничество с Протокол Лабс (Protocol Labs (PL)) для создания технологической базы для выполнения этой работы и, надеемся, поможем изобрести новую модель публикации эпохи Web3.

В то же время, как плюралисты, мы не хотим, чтобы эта книга касалось только «коренных жителей Web 3», и поэтому мы надеемся создать прекрасный физический объект, широкодоступный, распространяемый и рецензируемый в стандартных издательских и медиа-каналах.  Таким образом, мы нуждаемся в сотрудничестве не только с хакерами и писателями, но так же с дизайнерами, рассказчиками, маркетологами, переводчиками, издателями, и так далее. И мы понимаем, что некоторые из них предпочтут более индивидуальные выплаты, а не права управления гипотетически возможными заработками: и мы открыты для переговоров с партнерами по поводу таких возможностей, которые разделяют наши цели и видение касательно других параметров.  В любом случае, ни Одри, ни Глен не получат никакой компенсации или гонораров за свою работу над текстом, чтобы выполнить юридические обязательства, связанные с их работой, и гарантировать, что любой доход направлен на поддержку нашей миссии и сообщества, которое мы надеемся создать.

В скором времени мы представим программную платформу для поддержки общественного написания и управлением участия, но если у вас идеи относительно того, как вы можете быть полезны до этого, [пожалуйста пишите на Glen](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org).  Будущее технологий может соблюдать и поддерживать ценности, которыми мы дорожим, если мы будем работать вместе над тем, чтобы его вообразить и объяснить.

<h2>Обзор</h2>

Технологии и демократия находятся в состоянии войны: технологии укрепляют авторитарный надзор и разрушают демократические институты, в то время как демократия дает отпор ограничивающим контролем и консерватизмом государственного сектора.  Однако конфликт можно избежать; мы сделали выбор инвестировать в антидемократические технологии, такие как искусственный интеллект (ИИ) и криптовалюты. В некоторых местах, таких как сообщество Эфириума, Эстония, штат Колорадо и особенно Тайвань, вместо этого сосредоточились на технологиях, которые расширяют возможности для разностороннего сотрудничества, и стали свидетелями совместного процветания демократии и технологий. Эта книга, написанная лидерами новой парадигмы Плюральности, впервые описывает возможность ее использованиякаждым технологом, политиком, бизнес-лидером и активистом для построения более объединенного, разнообразного и продуктивно-демократического мира.

Когда "Убер" (Uber) появился в Тайване, его присутствие вызвало разногласия, как и в большинстве других стран мира.  Но в отличие от того, чтобы подливать масло в огонь как это сделали социальные сети, платформа vTaiwan, которую один из нас разработал в качестве министра, позволила гражданам, высказывающим свое мнение по этому вопросу, провести содержательное обсуждение с тысячами участников о том, как следует урегулировать процесс заказа такси.  В данной технологии использовались статистические инструменты, часто связанные с ИИ, для группирования мнений, позволяя каждому участнику быстро усваивать наиболее четкое изложение точек зрения своих сограждан и вносить на рассмотрение свои собственные мысли.  Взгляды, получившие поддержку по всем первоначальным вертикалям разделения, выходили в топ, сформировав предварительный консенсус, который обеспечил преимущества новых инструментов для вызова такси, а также защищал права работников и был внедрен правительством.  Этот процесс использовался для решения десятков спорных вопросов на Тайване, и быстро распространяется по миру среди правительств, кооперативов и блокчейн-сообществ.

Тем не менее, vTaiwan это лишь малая часть возможностей дизайна технологии для восприятия, отдания должного и преодоления социальных различий для сотрудничества.  Новые правила голосования и финансирования, возникшие в экосистеме Эфириума, могут изменить подход к управлению государственными и частными секторами; виртуальные миры с эффектом присутствия расширяют возможности эмпатических связей, позволяя выйти за рамки социальной изоляции; дизайн социальных сетей и новостных лент может создавать социальную сплоченность и совместное осмысление, а не разъединять нас.  И, как показал опыт Тайваня, потенциальные социальные выгоды огромны, что позволяет миру наилучшим образом реагировать на ряд недавних кризисов, начиная от пандемии Covid до дезинформации и создания всеобщего процветания.

Однако, в то время как несколько стран и экосистем вложили в такие технологии десятки миллионов долларов, остальной мир вложил сотни миллиардов в ИИ и криптографию, которые преследуют фундаментально иные цели. ИИ стремится автоматизацией свести на нет участие человека, централизовать власть, укрепить автократии, и ослабляя средний класс.  Спекулятивные криптовалюты, вызывающие пристрастие социальные сети и эскапистские «метавселенные» подорвали социальные структуры, усилили социальные разногласия, распространили инфодемию и увеличили уровень преступности.  Неудивительно, что страны, инвестировавшие в эти технологии, видят врагов в демократии и технологии.   Кроме того, такие подходы наносят ущерб не только социальным структурам, но и базовой структуре физической вселенной, чья квантовая природа, как недавно было показано, работает на принципах плюральности, и нашей живой Земле, изобилующей экологическим разнообразием.

Но еще не поздно изменить пути: мы можем инвестировать в технологии, устанавливающие цифровые права человека, расширяющие возможности плюральности и процветающие в демократических обществах, позволяя им превзойти авторитаризм и гиперкапитализм. Мы можем инвестировать, чтобы дать каждому человеку неотъемлемое право на цифровую личность с помощью нового поколения технологий децентрализованной идентификации (DID) нового поколения, позволяющие каждому человеку путешествовать, совершать сделки, вести бизнес и участвовать в демократических сообществах, свободных от централизованного наблюдения.  Мы можем реально добиться свободы участия в ассоциациях в цифровом мире, с подотчетными и управляемыми сообществами социальными сетями, а также с регистрами, которые сформируют администрации и форумы городов, одновременно наводя мосты над растущими разрывами между социальными группами.  Мы можем защитить права цифровой собственности, создав публичные рынки и главные улицы будущего с помощью криптографических технологий для безопасного и сохраняющего конфиденциальность обмена данными, вычислениями и хранилищем между одноранговыми узлами, свободными от контроля монополистов платформ.   Мы можем обеспечить право на торговлю с цифровыми валютами, которые поддерживаются государствами, сохраняющими конфиденциальность и являются функционально совместимыми на международном уровне.  И мы можем предоставить каждому гражданину доступ к этим правам, сделав высокоскоростной доступ в Интернет одним из прав человека, а обучение цифровой грамотности — основой учебных программ государственных школ.

Обеспечение этих основных цифровых прав человека делает плюральность в цифровом мире не только возможной, но и естественной.  На Тайване идеографические знаки для понятий «цифровой» и «плюральность» одинаковы: 數位. Их опыт в подобных экосистемах показал, как эти фонды, даже в зарождающейся форме, способствуют процветанию демократии.  Безопасные и конфиденциальные идентификаторы позволяют гражданам участвовать во взвешенных обсуждениях и обоснованных компромиссах, как в vTaiwan, не сталкиваясь с атаками со стороны троллей и ботов.  Использование личных данных позволяет районам и сообществам самостоятельно предоставлять услуги (от мониторинга загрязнения до карт доступности масок), а не полагаться на проприетарные платформы.  Открытые и надежные платежи позволяют творческим формам краудфандинга поддерживать предоставление публичных услуг без жесткой бюрократии. Децентрализованные репутационные системы позволяют гражданскому обществу бороться с дезинформацией, часто с юмором, сохраняя при этом живой и открытый диалог. А инвестиции, соответствующими их потенциалу, могут обеспечить смелое будущее; и все чаще становится очевидным, что квантовые компьютеры идеально подходят для поддержки плюральности по сравнению с другими техническими парадигмами.

Кроме того, хоть эти инструменты и могут трансформировать государственный сектор во всем мире, они актуальны не только для, или, в первую очередь актуальны для национальных демократий.  Вместо этого они предлагают способ для каждой организации, от церкви до корпорации, поощрять более продуктивное и динамичное сотрудничество.  Компании могут расширить возможности внутрикорпоративного предпринимательства и межотраслевой инфраструктуры быстрее, чем когда-либо прежде. Обмен частными и суверенными данными может сдерживать и лечить болезни.  Новое медиапространство может одновременно быть более доверительным и приводящим к консенсусу по ключевым фактам, чем когда-либо прежде, и в то же время расширять возможности голосов, игнорируемых традиционными кураторами. Таким образом, плюральность предназначена не только для политики и правительства, точно так же, как Интернет не был предназначен для военных и учреждений, которые изначально его и создали. Наоборот, это новая технологическая парадигма, которая может изменить каждый сектор и жизнь каждого человека к лучшему, если мы научимся ее использовать.

Но так же, как Интернет и другие преобразующие технологии, Плюральность будет процветать только в той мере, в какой мы в нее инвестируем. Интернет начал работу как сеть, созданная Агентством перспективных исследовательских проектов Министерства обороны США (ARPANET) для экспериментов с новыми децентрализованными конструкциями пользовательского интерфейса.  Тем не менее, видение основателей ARPANET, таких как Дж. С. Р. Ликлайдер, на основе которого построено наше, было реализовано лишь частично, потому что оно никогда не прибегало к общественности и международной поддержке и межотраслевых инвестиций, необходимых для его реализации. Вместо этого, как и прогнозировал Ликлайдер, его в основном захватили монополисты, которые свели его потенциал на нет.  Сегодня у нас есть шанс исправить эту ошибку и построить будущее, в котором наши технологии выражают и укрепляют наши самые высокие идеалы, а не низводят их.  Каждый активист, художник, технолог, гражданин, политический деятель и организация должны сыграть ключевую роль в борьбе за это будущее.

Когда мы видим «интернет вещей», давайте сделаем его интернетом существ.

Когда мы видим «виртуальную реальность», давайте сделаем ее общей реальностью.

    </div> Конфликты между технологиями и демократией одновременно, занимающие первые полосы, отражают и скрывают более глубокую напряженность между направлениями развития технологий и принципами демократического общества.  Хотя конкретные технологии, вышедшие из традиций ИИ и Web 3, обладают значительным потенциалом, по своей сути они являются антидемократическими политическими идеологиями, а не технологиями, ориентированными на централизацию власти и крайний индивидуализм соответственно.

        Жизнь в плюралистическом мире (15 страниц): От самого базового физического уровня квантовой механики до величайших высот «красота, рост, прогресс — все это результат союза непохожего». (Цитата из «Звездного пути»).  Таким образом, все это зависит от сохранения и распространения разнообразия, и в тоже время от укрепления коммуникации и сотрудничества, несмотря на различия. Информационно-коммуникационные технологии могут отображать динамический ландшафт социальных отношений и способствовать новым связям и организациям, охватывающим такие сети.

        Утраченное Дао (15 страниц) Идея сетевого общества, в котором индивиды и социальные группы являются динамическими пересечениями друг друга, возникла в теориях социологов, экономистов и философов, таких как Генри Джордж, Георг Зиммель и Джон Дьюи.  Это видение легло в основу того, что стало Интернетом, но никогда не было сформулировано с философской ясностью, что позволило забыть о нем и заменить его другими философиями, сосредоточенными на имитации человеческого интеллекта или освобождении людей от социальных связей.  Эта книга имеет целью восстановить утраченное видение, показать, насколько оно может быть успешно, и очертить путь к его процветанию.

        Вид из Ю Шаня (20 страниц) Тайвань находится на пересечении континентальных плит Евразии и Америки, а также на идеологическом пересечении китайской централизованной идеологии искусственного интеллекта, американской гиперкапиталистической идеологии и европейских регуляторных государств, основанных на общих ценностях.  Как линия физического разлома подняла самую высокую точку Тайваня, Юй Шань, еще выше, так и идеологическая напряженность подтолкнула Тайвань к развитию плюралистического синтеза, который позволил ему стать самой технологически развитой и самой активно-демократической страной в мире.  Эта глава предоставит яркий и эмоциональный портрет жизни в условиях цифровой демократии Тайваня с разных точек зрения: министра, гражданского активиста, обычного гражданина, не связанного с цифровыми технологиями, бизнесмена и т.д.  В ней также будет кратко рассказана история возникновения цифровой демократии на Тайване, проведены параллели и контрасты с сегодняшними обстоятельствами других либерально-демократических стран.

        Права человека как операционная система (5 страниц): Точно так же, как промышленные демократии строятся на фундаменте всеобщих прав человека, цифровые демократии зависят от всеобщей защиты прав человека в цифровой сфере.  В настоящее время доступ к этим возможностям ограничен и является собственностью, что подрывает потенциал Плюральности.  Каждая глава в этом разделе будет начинаться с краткого описания взаимодействия, которое позволит реализовать это право.
      </li>
      <li>
        Личность (10 страниц): Права на жизнь, путешествия и личное признание являются наиболее фундаментальными правами, и тем не менее, системы идентификации, которые делают их возможными в Интернете, контролируются несколькими проприетарными платформами.  Децентрализованные и плюралистичные системы идентификации, которые в настоящее время появляются в пространстве Web 3, могут расширить ряд новых функций, которые выводят Интернет так же далеко за пределы его нынешнего состояния, как Интернет освоил предшествующие способы коммуникации.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ассоциация (10 страниц): Социальные сети очерчивают карту ассоциации в цифровую эпоху, а блокчейны обеспечивают цифровой эквивалент общественных площадей.  Если они могут быть расширены за счет инвестиций в общественных интересах для улучшения репутации и социальных отношений, которые они обеспечивают, они могут расширить охват социальных отношений глобальнее, чем на сегодняшний день, и заменить многие функции, традиционно приписываемые анонимному рыночному обмену.
      </li>
      <li>
        Коммерция (5 страниц): При участии легитимных институтов (таких как центральные банки, правительства и банки) цифровые валюты могут иметь сетевую структуру, которая обеспечивает как преимущества суверенитета и конфиденциальности, так и международное взаимодействие, обеспечивая платежам свободу от хаоса криптовалют и неэффективных монополий, которые в настоящее время доминируют в платежах.
      </li>
      <li>
        Собственность (10 страниц): В то время как основные активы цифрового мира (данные, вычисления и память) создаются дистрибутивным образом, отсутствие общедоступных стандартов для безопасного обмена ими, сконцентрировало власть в руках нескольких крупных технологических компаний.  Бюджетные инвестиции в разработку общедоступных стандартов для безопасного обмена в этих областях позволят гражданскому обществу и бизнес-группам достичь гораздо более амбициозного сотрудничества, более эффективно, с большим доверием, конфиденциальностью и суверенитетом.
      </li>
      <li>
        Доступ и обучение (5 страниц): Онлайн права человека релевантны только для тех, кто имеет доступ и знания для навигации в кибер-пространстве.  Поэтому высокоскоростной широкополосный доступ и цифровая компетентность, а не только грамотность и образование, должны быть универсальными правами человека.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Демократия</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Демократия как Приложения (10 страниц): Демократические институты — это приложения, которые могут работать на таких основах и имеют в основе три главных компонента: обсуждение, компромисс и плюрализм.  Эти институты могут трансформировать не только государственный, но и частный сектор, демократизируя бизнес, и, в свою очередь, зависят от таких демократизированных моделей финансирования.  Каждая глава будет начинаться с краткой зарисовки о том, как современные технологии используются для достижения цифровой демократии.
      </li>
      <li>
        Рассуждение (5 страниц): Достижения в статистике (часто связанные с ИИ) делают возможным «широкое прослушивание», когда миллионы людей могут услышать профильтрованную суть распределения мнений своих коллег, масштабируя возможности демократического обсуждения.
      </li>
      <li>
        Компромисс (5 страниц): Достижения в разработке механизмов (часто связанные с Web 3) делают возможными масштабные компромиссы и торги, обеспечивая прямую демократию, которая не попадает в ловушки тирании большинства.
      </li>
      <li>
        Плюрализм (5 страниц): Социальные сети позволяют нам отслеживать социальные расколы и разногласия, позволяя как расширять возможности «местных» сообществ для самоуправления, так и активно создавать стимулы для преодоления этих разногласий.
      </li>
      <li>
        Финансы (5 страниц): Новые формы социальной организации, возникающие в сообществе Web 3, позволяют нам преодолеть разрыв между рынком и государством, создавая новый социальный сектор, который может предоставлять широкий спектр демократических услуг.

    </div> Демократия получила плохую репутацию в большей части мира из-за неспособности решить важнейшие глобальные проблемы.  Это потому, что она не поспевает за технологиями; а когда это происходит, опыт Тайваня доказывает, что она может превзойти авторитарный режим.  В каждой главе будут представлены статистические данные, иллюстрирующие возможность успеха таких стран, как Тайвань и Эстония, которые сделали цифровую демократию реальностью.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Медиа (5 страниц): Дезинформацию можно сдерживать, сохраняя экспрессию свободы слова с помощью алгоритмов, которые выводят контент на поверхность с удивительным консенсусом и активным участием групп гражданского общества, использующих юмор.
      </li>
      <li>
        Здравоохранение (5 страниц): Пандемии и другие кризисы в области общественного здравоохранения можно выявлять и реагировать на них быстро и с минимальными экономическими затратами, если гражданское общество сможет быстро разработать системы для распределения ограниченных ресурсов здравоохранения и борьбы с цепочками передачи инфекции.

        Окружающая среда (5 страниц): Ущерб окружающей среде, от локального до глобального, может быть быстро выявлен без вторжения в частную жизнь, если граждане способны формировать горизонтальные «коалиции данных», которые могут вести переговоры с правительствами, чтобы выполнять свои обязанности и обеспечивать то же самое для членов сообщества.
      </li>
      <li>
        Рабочие места (5 страниц): Используя цифровые технологии для вовлечения людей, а не для их замены, цифровые технологии могут создавать лучшие рабочие места, чем те, которые они затмевают, что естественным образом приведет к всеобщему процветанию и вовлеченности.

        Учреждения (20 страниц): Крупно-масштабные инвестиции, необходимые для реализации Плюральности, потребуют объединения источников финансирования из различных секторов и стран, чтобы объединить и превзойти мотивы национальных интересов, прибыли и благотворительности.  Эксперименты с различными сообществами во многих географических точках должны быть тесно связаны со стандартизацией, которая может достичь международного масштаба, используя сеть цифровых министров, подобных той, что используется на Тайване.  Предприятия частного сектора, академические учреждения, благотворительные организации и активисты должны внести свой вклад, руководствуясь престижем и видением будущего, которое приходит с вкладом в будущее общедоступных стандартов.  Несмотря на амбициозность, этот план в значительной степени расширяет историю Интернета, стимулируемого сетью пользовательских исследовательских лабораторий, финансируемых Агентством перспективных исследовательских проектов (ARPANET), расширяя его до нашего нынешнего многополярного мира.
      </li>
      <li>
        Действие (10 страниц): Хотя для достижения успеха потребуется координация на самом высоком уровне, каждый гражданин должен сыграть свою роль, чтобы создать импульс, который сделает это возможным.  Мы покажем, как хакеры, инвесторы, бизнесмены, активисты, художники, избиратели могут стать частью движения за то, чтобы наши инструменты служили нашим ценностям, а не были ими продиктованы.

Presentazione e richiesta di collaborazione su Plurality: Tecnologia per la Diversità e la Democrazia Collaborative

Autori: Audrey Tang, E. Glen Weyl

*Traduzione in Italiano: Andrea Brena*

Stiamo per intraprendere un viaggio e speriamo che vi uniate a noi. Nell'ultimo mezzo decennio, in collaborazione con molti di voi, abbiamo sviluppato un'alternativa alle solite narrativesul futuro della tecnologia che si concentrano sulla finanziarizzazione o sull'intelligenza artificiale centralizzata. *Plurality*, come la chiamiamo noi, è una tecnologia che riconosce, onora e potenzia la cooperazione attraverso le differenze sociali e culturali. Per saperne di più, vi invitiamo a leggere la panoramica qui sotto. Crediamo che Plurality sia il paradigma tecnologico naturale per sostenere la prosperità delle società democratiche e che possa superare molte delle divisioni radicate nel mondo odierno. Vogliamo far conoscere al mondo questa possibilità, in modo da stimolare investimenti e sperimentazioni diversificati e coordinati che possano trasformarla in realtà. E vogliamo il vostro aiuto.

Mentre il nostro piano preciso si definirà con i progressi della ricerca di Plurality e le realtà pratiche, ci impegniamo a incarnare le idee del libro nel modo in cui lo creiamo, lo distribuiamo e lo sosteniamo finanziariamente. Tutto il materiale sarà un'Opera Culturale Libera (Free Cultural Work), tra le categorie più permissive della licenza Creative Commons. Intendiamo scrivere il libro pubblicamente in una struttura simile a Git, dove apertamente, solleciteremo l'assistenza editoriale e di ricerca dalla comunità stessa e ingaggeremo coloro che con in loro contributo, ci aiuteranno a dare priorità alle richieste di modifica (pull requests) e infine a controllare i contenuti del libro. Sosterremo i costi per la pubblicazione del libro utilizzando una serie di meccanismi web3-nativi, tra cui sovvenzioni per finanziamenti plurali/quadratici, "firme" NFT su copie fisiche e digitali acquistate del libro e NFT SALSA/Harberger per l'accesso a Glen come relatore/consulente su tematiche legate al libro. Ruoli di contributo al libro verrano rappresentati da Soulbound Token (SBT) che verranno utilizzati come base per governare le scelte sul contenuto dopo la pubblicazione, compresa la disposizione di gran parte dei fondi raccolti, convertendo la comunità del libro in una Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO). Collaboreremo a stretto contatto con Protocol Labs (PL) per costruire il substrato tecnologico necessario a far funzionare tutto ciò e, auspicabilmente, contribuire a inventare un nuovo modello di editoria per l'era del web3.

Allo stesso tempo, in quanto pluralisti, non vogliamo raggiungere solo i "nativi del web3", e quindi speriamo di farne un bell'oggetto fisico, ampiamente accessibile, distribuito e recensito nei canali editoriali e mediatici standard. Per questo motivo, abbiamo bisogno che collaborino con noi non solo hacker e scrittori, ma anche designer, narratori, marketer, traduttori, editori e così via. Siamo consapevoli che alcuni di loro preferiranno diritti di governance più individuali in prospettiva di potenziali guadagni speculativi, e siamo aperti a discutere alternative con partner che condividono i nostri obiettivi e la nostra visione. In ogni caso, né Audrey né Glen riceveranno alcun compenso o royalty per il loro lavoro sul testo, per ottemperare alle responsabilità legali associate al loro impiego e per garantire che qualsiasi entrata sostenga la nostra missione e la comunità che speriamo di costruire.

Presto debutterà la piattaforma digitale che supporterà la stesura pubblica del libro e la gestione della partecipazione, ma se percepite un modo in cui volete contribuire prima di allora, non esitate a [scrivere a Glen](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org). Il futuro della tecnologia può onorare e sostenere i valori a noi cari se lavoriamo insieme per immaginarlo e spiegarlo.

<h2>Panoramica</h2>

Tecnologia e democrazia sono in guerra: la tecnologia rafforza la sorveglianza autoritaria e corrode le istituzioni democratiche, mentre le democrazie reagiscono con regolamentazioni vincolanti e il conservatorismo del settore pubblico. Eppure questo conflitto non è inevitabile; è una scelta che abbiamo fatto investendo in tecnologie antidemocratiche, come l'intelligenza artificiale (AI) e le criptovalute. Alcuni luoghi, come la comunità di Ethereum, l'Estonia, lo Stato del Colorado e soprattutto Taiwan, si sono invece concentrati su tecnologie che consentono una collaborazione diversificata e hanno visto fiorire insieme democrazia e tecnologia. Questo libro, scritto dai leader di questo nuovo paradigma della pluralità, mostra per la prima volta come ogni tecnologo, politico, imprenditore e attivista possa sfruttarlo per costruire un mondo più collaborativo, diversificato e produttivamente democratico.

Quando Uber è arrivata a Taiwan, la sua presenza è stata divisiva, proprio come lo è stata in gran parte del mondo. Ma piuttosto che gettare benzina sul fuoco attraverso i social media, la piattaforma vTaiwan, che uno di noi ha sviluppato in veste di ministro in quel Paese, ha permesso ai cittadini di esprimersi sulla questione avendo una conversazione ponderata e deliberativa con migliaia di partecipanti su come dovrebbe essere regolamentato il servizio di ride-sharing. Questa tecnologia ha sfruttato strumenti statistici spesso associati all'intelligenza artificiale per raggruppare le opinioni, consentendo a ogni partecipante di processare rapidamente l'articolazione più chiara dei punti di vista dei propri concittadini e di contribuire con i propri pensieri. Partendo da dissensi iniziali, i punti di vista che hanno raccolto più consensi sono stati messi in risalto, formando quindi un consenso approssimativo che garantisse i vantaggi dei nuovi strumenti di ride-sharing, proteggendo al contempo i diritti dei lavoratori, risultando nella loro implementazione. Questo processo è stato utilizzato per risolvere decine di questioni controverse a Taiwan e si sta rapidamente diffondendo in tutto il mondo presso governi, cooperative e comunità blockchain.

Tuttavia, vTaiwan scalfisce appena la superficie di come la tecnologia possa essere progettata per percepire, onorare e colmare le differenze sociali a favore della collaborazione. Le nuove regole di voto e di finanziamento che emergono dall'ecosistema Ethereum possono rimodellare il modo in cui governiamo i settori pubblico e privato; i mondi virtuali immersivi favoriscono le connessioni empatiche che attraversano le linee di esclusione sociale; i social network e i newsfeed possono essere progettati per costruire la coesione sociale e il sensemaking condiviso, anziché allontanarci. E, come ha dimostrato l'esperienza di Taiwan, i potenziali benefici sociali sono vasti, consentendo la migliore risposta del mondo a una serie di crisi recenti, dalla pandemia di Covid alla disinformazione, fino alla creazione di una prosperità ampiamente condivisa.

Tuttavia, mentre alcuni Paesi ed ecosistemi hanno investito decine di milioni di dollari in queste tecnologie, il resto del mondo ha investito centinaia di miliardi nell'intelligenza artificiale e nelle criptovalute, che perseguono obiettivi fondamentalmente diversi. L'AI (artificial intelligence) mira ad automatizzare la partecipazione umana, centralizzando il potere, rafforzando le autocrazie e minando la classe media. Le criptovalute speculative, i social media che creano dipendenza e i "metaversi" di evasione hanno minato il tessuto sociale, rafforzato le divisioni sociali, diffondendo un'infodemia e facendo proliferare nuove forme di criminalità. Non sorprende quindi che i Paesi che hanno investito in queste tecnologie vedano la democrazia e la tecnologia come nemici.

Ma non è troppo tardi per cambiare strada: possiamo investire in tecnologie che stabiliscano i diritti umani digitali, rafforzino il pluralismo e facciano fiorire le società democratiche, consentendo loro di superare l'autoritarismo e l'ipercapitalismo. Possiamo investire per dare a ogni persona un diritto inalienabile alla personalità digitale con una nuova generazione di tecnologie di identità decentralizzate (DID) che consentano a ogni persona di viaggiare, effettuare transazioni, condurre affari e partecipare a comunità democratiche libere dalla sorveglianza centralizzata. Possiamo rendere reale la libertà di associazione nel mondo digitale con social network e ledger responsabili gestiti dalle comunità e che formano i municipi e le piazze pubbliche del futuro, colmando le crescenti divisioni tra i gruppi. Possiamo garantire i diritti di proprietà digitale creando mercati pubblici e le strade principali del futuro con tecnologie crittografiche per la condivisione sicura e rispettosa della privacy di dati, calcolo e archiviazione tra utenti, liberi dal controllo monopolistico delle piattaforme. Possiamo garantire il diritto al commercio con valute digitali interoperabili a livello internazionale, sostenute dai governi e rispettose della privacy. E possiamo consentire a ogni cittadino di accedere a questi diritti rendendo l'Internet ad alta velocità un diritto umano e l'educazione alle competenze digitali un elemento centrale dei programmi scolastici pubblici.

Garantire questi diritti umani digitali fondamentali rende il pluralismo nel mondo digitale non solo possibile, ma naturale. A Taiwan, i caratteri ideografici per "digitale" e "plurale" sono gli stessi: 數位. L'esperienza in questo Paese e in ecosistemi simili ha dimostrato come queste basi, anche in forma nascente, promuovano una democrazia fiorente. Identità sicure e private consentono ai cittadini di partecipare a deliberazioni ponderate e a compromessi ragionati, come nel caso di vTaiwan, senza subire attacchi da parte di troll e bot. La condivisione privata dei dati consente ai quartieri e alle comunità di fornire servizi (dal monitoraggio dell'inquinamento alle mappe di disponibilità delle maschere) per conto proprio piuttosto che affidarsi a piattaforme proprietarie. I pagamenti aperti e affidabili permettono a forme creative di crowdfunding di sostenere i beni comuni senza burocrazie macchinose. I sistemi di reputazione peer-to-peer permettono alla società civile di combattere la disinformazione, spesso con umorismo, mantenendo un discorso vivace e aperto.

Inoltre, sebbene questi strumenti possano trasformare il settore pubblico in tutto il mondo, non sono rilevanti solo o principalmente per le democrazie nazionali. Offrono invece un modo a diverse forme organizzaztive, dalle chiese alle aziende, di promuovere una cooperazione più produttiva e dinamica. Le aziende possono potenziare l'intrapreneurship e le infrastrutture interdivisionali più velocemente che mai. La condivisione di dati privati e sovrani può contenere e curare le malattie. Un nuovo panorama mediatico può essere al tempo stesso più affidabile e consensuale sui fatti chiave di quanto non sia mai stato prima, dando al tempo stesso voce a coloro emarginati a causa dei tradizionali gatekeepers (custodi). Plurality non è quindi solo per la politica e il governo, così come l’Internet non lo era per i militari e le università che l'hanno costruito. È invece un nuovo paradigma tecnologico che può trasformare in meglio ogni settore e la vita di ogni individuo se impariamo a sfruttarlo.

Ma proprio come Internet e altre tecnologie trasformative, Plurality potrà prosperare solo relativamente a quanto investiremo in essa. Internet è nato come una rete creata dall'Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET) del Dipartimento della Difesa degli Stati Uniti per sperimentare nuovi design di interfacce utente decentralizzate. Tuttavia, la visione dei fondatori di ARPANET, come JCR Licklider, su cui la nostra è strettamente modellata, è stata realizzata solo in parte perché non ha mai mobilitato il sostegno pubblico e internazionale e gli investimenti multisettoriali necessari per portarla avanti. Invece, come previsto da Licklider, è stato per lo più catturato da monopolisti che ne hanno ostacolato il potenziale. Oggi abbiamo la possibilità di correggere quell'errore e di costruire un futuro in cui le nostre tecnologie esprimano e potenzino i nostri ideali più nobili, anziché degradarli. Ogni attivista, artista, tecnologo, cittadino, politico e organizzazione ha un ruolo chiave da svolgere nella lotta per questo futuro.

Quando vediamo "internet delle cose", facciamo in modo che sia un internet degli persone.

Quando vediamo "realtà virtuale", rendiamola una realtà condivisa.

Quando vediamo "machine learning", rendiamolo un apprendimento collaborativo.

Quando vediamo "user experience", facciamo in modo che si tratti di esperienza umana.

Quando sentiamo dire "la singolarità è vicina", ricordiamoci che la pluralità è qui.

    </div> I conflitti da titolo di giornale tra tecnologia e democrazia, riflettono e nascondono al tempo stesso una tensione più profonda tra le direzioni in cui si è sviluppata la tecnologia e i principi di una società democratica. Sebbene le tecnologie specifiche nate dalle tradizioni dell'intelligenza artificiale e del web3 abbiano un potenziale significativo, esse sono fondamentalmente ideologie politiche antidemocratiche piuttosto che tecnologie, impegnandosi rispettivamente nella centralizzazione del potere e nell'individualismo estremo.

        Vivere in un mondo plurale (15 pagine): Dal livello fisico più elementare della meccanica quantistica alle più grandi altezze, "la bellezza, la crescita, il progresso - sono tutti il risultato dell'unione dei diversi". (Citazione di Star Trek). Tutto ciò dipende quindi dal mantenimento e dalla proliferazione della diversità, rafforzando al contempo la comunicazione e la cooperazione attraverso le differenze. Le tecnologie dell'informazione e della comunicazione possono mappare il paesaggio dinamico delle relazioni sociali e facilitare nuove connessioni e organizzazioni che si estendono su tali network.

        La DAO perduta (15 pagine) L'idea di una società a rete, in cui gli individui e i gruppi sociali sono entrambi intersezioni dinamiche tra loro, ha avuto origine nelle teorie di sociologi, economisti e filosofi come Henry George, Georg Simmel e John Dewey. Questa visione è stata alla base di quello che è diventato Internet, ma non è mai stata articolata con chiarezza filosofica, permettendo che venisse dimenticata e soppiantata da altre filosofie, incentrate sull'imitazione dell'intelligenza umana o sulla liberazione degli individui dai vincoli sociali. Questo libro si propone di recuperare questa visione perduta, di mostrare come essa abbia e possa avere successo e di tracciare un percorso per farla prosperare.

        Uno sguardo da Yu Shan (20 pagine) Taiwan si trova all'intersezione delle placche continentali dell'Eurasia e dell'America e all'intersezione ideologica dell'ideologia cinese centralizzata dell'IA, dell'ideologia americana ipercapitalista e degli Stati regolatori europei basati su valori. Come la linea di faglia fisica ha spinto in alto il punto più alto di Taiwan, lo Yu Shan, così queste tensioni ideologiche hanno spinto Taiwan a sviluppare una sintesi pluralista che gli ha permesso di diventare il Paese tecnologicamente più avanzato e più attivamente democratico del mondo. Questo capitolo fornirà un ritratto vivido ed emotivo della vita nella democrazia digitale di Taiwan da più punti di vista: quello del ministro, quello di un attivista civico, quello di un comune cittadino disimpegnato digitalmente, quello di un imprenditore, ecc. Verrà anche raccontata brevemente la storia di come è nata la democrazia digitale di Taiwan, tracciando paralleli e contrasti con le circostanze di altri Paesi liberaldemocratici di oggi.

        Diritti umani come sistema operativo (5 pagine) Così come le democrazie industriali sono costruite sulle fondamenta dei diritti universali dell’uomo, le democrazie digitali dipendono dalla difesa universale dei diritti dell’uomo nel mondo digitale. Al momento, l'accesso a queste capacità è limitato e proprietario, minando il potenziale di Plurality. Ogni capitolo di questa sezione inizierà con un breve schizzo di un'interazione consentita dalla realizzazione di questo diritto.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personalità (10 pagine) I diritti alla vita, agli spostamenti e al riconoscimento personale sono i diritti più fondamentali, ma i sistemi di identità che li rendono possibili online sono controllati da poche piattaforme proprietarie. I sistemi di identità decentralizzati e pluralistici che stanno emergendo dallo spazio Web3 possono dare vita a una serie di nuove funzionalità che porteranno Internet al di là del suo stato attuale, così come Internet ha portato avanti le modalità di comunicazione precedenti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Associazione (10 pagine) I social network mappano l'associazione nell'era digitale, mentre le blockchain forniscono l'equivalente digitale delle piazze pubbliche. Se queste ultime possono essere ampliate da investimenti di interesse pubblico, arrichendo così la reputazione e le relazioni sociali che esse veicolano, saranno in grado di estendere la portata delle relazioni sociali a molto più di quanto lo siano oggi e di sostituire molte delle funzioni tradizionalmente assegnate allo scambio anonimo sul mercato.
      </li>
      <li>
        Commercio (5 pagine) Con la partecipazione di istituzioni legittime (come banche centrali, governi e banche), le valute digitali possono avere una struttura di rete che consenta sia i vantaggi della sovranità e della privacy sia l'interoperabilità internazionale, liberando i pagamenti dal caos delle criptovalute e dagli inefficienti monopoli che attualmente dominano i pagamenti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Proprietà (10 pagine) Mentre i beni fondamentali del mondo digitale (dati, calcolo e memoria) sono creati in modo distribuito, la mancanza di standard aperti per condividerli in modo sicuro ha concentrato il potere in poche grandi aziende tecnologiche. L'investimento pubblico nello sviluppo di standard aperti per la condivisione sicura in queste aree consentirà alla società civile e ai gruppi imprenditoriali di realizzare collaborazioni molto più ambiziose, in modo più efficiente, con maggiore fiducia, privacy e sovranità.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accesso e istruzione (5 pagine) I diritti umani online sono rilevanti solo per coloro che possono accedere e navigare nel cyberspazio. L'accesso alla banda larga ad alta velocità e la competenza digitale, non solo la cultura, devono quindi essere diritti umani universali.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">La democrazia</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Democrazia come applicazione (10 pagine) Le istituzioni democratiche sono applicazioni che possono funzionare su queste basi e hanno tre componenti fondamentali: deliberazione, compromesso e pluralismo. Queste istituzioni possono trasformare non solo il settore pubblico ma anche quello privato, democratizzando le imprese e dipendendo a loro volta da modelli di finanziamento democratizzati. Ogni capitolo inizierà con una vignetta sui modi in cui le tecnologie vengono utilizzate oggi per realizzare la democrazia digitale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliberazione (5 pagine) I progressi della statistica (spesso associati all'intelligenza artificiale) rendono possibile un "ascolto ampio", in cui milioni di persone possono ascoltare l'essenza distillata della distribuzione delle opinioni dei loro pari, dando potere alla deliberazione democratica su scala.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compromesso (5 pagine) I progressi nella progettazione dei meccanismi (spesso associati al web3) rendono possibile il compromesso e la negoziazione su scala, consentendo una democrazia diretta che non cada nelle trappole della tirannia della maggioranza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pluralismo (5 pagine) Le reti sociali ci permettono di tracciare le fratture e le divisioni sociali, consentendoci di dare alle comunità "locali" il potere di autogovernarsi e di creare attivamente incentivi per colmare queste divisioni.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finanza (5 pagine) Le nuove forme di organizzazione sociale che emergono dalla comunità web3 ci permettono di superare la divisione tra mercato e Stato, creando un settore sociale emergente in grado di fornire servizi democratici su scala.

La sperimentazione con comunità diverse in molte località geografiche dovrà essere strettamente legata alla standardizzazione mirata ad una scala internazionale, sfruttando una reti di ministri digitali come quella di Taiwan. Le aziende del settore privato, le istituzioni accademiche, le organizzazioni di beneficenza e gli attivisti dovranno essere coinvolti nei contributi, attirati dal prestigio e dalla visione del futuro che deriva dal contribuire al futuro degli standard aperti. Pur essendo ambizioso, questo piano estende in larga misura la storia di Internet stimolata dalla rete di laboratori di ricerca per gli utenti finanziata dall'Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET), estendendola al nostro attuale mondo multipolare.

새로운 기술 패러다임에 대한 개념을 소개하고 협력을 구하는 글

Plurality: 협력적 다양성과 민주주의를 위한 기술

Audrey Tang, E. Glen Weyl

*Korean translation by Haju Jang*

지금 시작되려는 이 여정에 여러분이 함께 하기를 원합니다. 우리는 지난 수년간 많은 이들과의 협업을 통해 기술의 미래에 대한 이야기의 초점이 금융의 영역 확장이나, 중앙집중화된 인공지능에 맞춰지는 일반화된 행태를 바꾸기 위해 노력해 왔습니다. 이제 우리가 Plurality(다원성)라고 부르는 것은 사회적, 문화적 차이를 넘어 협력과 공존의 가능성을 인지하고, 증진하고, 강화하는 하나의 기술입니다. 이에 대해서는 아래의 개요에서 좀 더 자세히 설명하고 있습니다. 우리는 Plurality가 민주적 사회를 융성하게 할 뿐만 아니라 오늘날 우리가 겪고 있는 뿌리깊은 분열을 극복하려면 자연스럽게 떠올릴 수밖에 없는 기술적 패러다임이라고 믿습니다. 우리는 이 가능성을 세상에 알려서 이를 현실로 만들어 줄 다양하고 조화로운 투자와 여러 실험들을 유도하고자합니다. 그리고 무엇보다 우리는 여러분의 도움이 필요합니다.  

우리의 세부 계획은 Plurality 연구 및 실제 현실의 발전양상과 함께 바뀌어 가겠지만, 지금으로서는 우리가 무엇인가를 만들어내고, 유통하고, 재정적으로 지원하는데 익숙한 방식으로 책의 아이디어를 구체화하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 모든 자료는 크리에이티브 커먼즈(Creative Commons) 라이선스 중 가장 개방성이 높은 범주인 Free Cultural Work가 될 것입니다. 또한 Git 방식으로 공개적으로 책을 작성할 계획이기 때문에, 커뮤니티에서 공개적으로 편집 및 연구 지원을 요청하고, pull request 중  우선순위를 정하거나 최종적으로 책의 내용을 결정하는데에 도움을 줄 사람들을 모집할 것입니다. 필요한 비용의 경우, Plural/Quadratic Funding 보조금, 책 실물 및 디지털 사본에 대한 NFT 서명, (주 저자인) Glen에게 강연 혹은 컨설팅 요청을 할 수 있는 SALSA/Harberger NFT 등을 포함하여 다양한 Web3 기반 메커니즘을 사용할 것입니다. 또한 소울바운드 토큰(SBTs)을 사용하여 책 작성 기여자들을 표시할(represent) 것이며, 이를 실제 출판 이후 컨텐츠 통제 뿐만 아니라 조달된 펀드의 배분 등에 대한 거버넌스 기반으로 삼을 것입니다. 그리고 이를 통해 책 작성에 기여한 커뮤니티를 탈중앙화 자율조직(DAO; Distribited Autonomous Organization) 형태의 일종으로 전환하고자 합니다. 우리는 이 작업뿐만 아니라 Web3 시대의 새로운 출판 모델을 만들어내기 위한 기술 기반(substrate)을 마련하기 위해서 PL(Protocol Labs)과 긴밀히 협력할 것입니다.

다원주의자로서 우리는 “Web3 네이티브”에게만 다가가기를 원하지 않고, 이 책이 실물로도 아름답고, 접하기 쉬울 뿐만 아니라, 표준 출판 및 미디어 유통채널을 통해서 배포되고 리뷰되기를 원합니다. 그렇기 때문에 우리에게는 단지 해커와 작가만 필요한 것이 아니라 디자이너, 스토리텔러, 마케터, 번역가, 출판인 등이 필요합니다. 이러한 참여자들 중 일부는 불확실하고(speculative) 잠재적인 현금흐름에 대한 거버넌스 권한보다는 개별적인 권리를 더 선호한다는 것도 잘 이해하고 있으며, 따라서 다른 차원에서라도 우리의 목표와 비전을 공유하는 파트너와의 협상에 우리가 언제나 열려 있다는 점을 말씀드리고 싶습니다. Audrey와 Glen은 그들의 고용과 관련된 법적 책임을 준수하고, 우리가 만들고자 하는 커뮤니티와 그 미션의 성취를 위해 필요한 재정을 확보하기 위해서, 어떠한 경우라도 작업에 대한 개인적 보상이나 로열티를 받지 않을 것입니다.

곧 공개적인 글 작성 등 참여과정을 관리하는 소프트웨어 플랫폼을 선보일 예정이나, 그전에 언제라도 기여하고 싶은 아이디어가 있다면 [이메일을 보내 주십시오](mailto:glen@radicalxchnage.org). 우리가 기술의 미래를 함께 상상하고 함께 구체화해(explain) 나갈 때, 기술이 우리의 소중한 가치를 고취하는 동시에 실현가능하게 합니다.

<h2>개요</h2>

기술과 민주주의는 서로 전쟁중 입니다. 기술은 권위주의적 감시를 강화하고 민주주의 제도를 후퇴시키고 있는 반면, 민주주의는 (기술의 무차별한 침투를) 제한하는 규제와 공공부문에 있어서는 보수적인 접근을 취함으로써 (public sector conservatism) 기술에 맞서 싸우고 있습니다. 하지만 이러한 갈등은 필연적인 것이 아니며, 오히려 우리가 인공지능(AI)이나 암호화폐(Cryptocurrencies)와 같은 반민주주의적인 기술들에 투자해온 선택의 결과에 가깝습니다. Ethereum  커뮤니티나 에스토니아, 콜로라도주, 그리고 특별히 대만과 같은 일부 지역에서는 대신 다양한 협업을 촉진하는 기술들에 집중했고, 그 결과 민주주의와 기술이 함께 발전해나가는 것을 경험했습니다. 이 책은 Plurality 패러다임 선구자들의 도움을 힘입어, 어떻게 모든 기술자, 정책입안자, 비즈니스 리더, 그리고 사회운동가가 기술을 활용하여 더 협력적이고, 다양하고, 생산적인 민주적 세상을 만들수 있는지를 처음으로 제시할 것입니다.

Uber가 대만에 진출했을 때, 전세계 대부분의 사업지에서 그랬듯이 분열을 유발하는 존재였습니다. 그러나 이러한 갈등의 불꽃에 기름을 붓는 소셜미디어를 대신해, 대만의 장관이자 우리 멤버중 한명이 개발한 vTaiwan 플랫폼은 Uber 이슈에 의견을 가진 수많은 시민들이 승차공유 서비스 규제에 대한 사려깊고 심도있는 논의를 할 수 있도록 해주었습니다. vTaiwan은 인공지능을 활용한 통계도구를 통해 수많은 의견을 효과적으로 그룹화함으로써(cluster) 참여자들이 다른 의견들을 최대한 분명하고 빠르게 소화하고, 이를 바탕으로 자신의 생각을 공유할 수 있도록 도왔습니다. 점차 처음에는 분열됐던 집단들 사이에서 공통의 지지를 얻는 의견이 도출되었고, 새로운 서비스의 혜택을 내버리지 않으면서도 노동자의 권리를 보호할 수 있는 개략적 합의가 형성되어 정부가 이를 시행하기에 이르렀습니다. 이외에도 이 프로세스는 대만내에서 논쟁을 초래하는 다른 여러 이슈들을 해결하는데 활용되었으며, 전 세계적으로 정부, 여러 협업체, 그리고 블록체인 커뮤니티로 빠르게 확산되고 있습니다.

그러나 vTaiwan은 기술이 궁극적으로 사람 간의 협력을 이끌어 내기 위해 어떻게 사회적 다름을 인지하고, 존중하고, 연결할 수 있도록 설계되어야 하는지에 대해 단지 표면만 건드려 본 것이라고 할 수 있습니다. Ethereum 생태계에 기반한 새로운 투표 시스템 및 자금조달 메커니즘은 우리가 공공 및 민간 부문을 조직하고 운영하는 (govern) 방식을 바꿀 수 있습니다. 몰입형 가상 세계는 사회적인 배제로 (social exclusion) 그어진 보이지 않는 선을 넘나드는 공감적 연결을 강화해줄 것입니다. 소셜 네트워크 서비스와 뉴스피드는 우리를 갈라놓기 보다는 사회적 결속과 공감대를 형성하도록 설계될 수 있습니다. 대만의 경험이 보여주듯 (기술을 올바르게 활용할 때의) 잠재적인 사회적 이득은 광범위합니다. 대만은 최근 코로나19 팬데믹부터 정보왜곡 (및 공유된 번영의 창출)에 이르는 일련의 사건에 대해 세계의 모범이 될 만한 대응을 보여줬습니다.

그러나, 일부 나라와 생태계가 (바람직한) 기술에 수천만 달러를 투자하고 있는가 하면, 나머지 세계는 근본적으로 다른 지향점을 가지고 있는 인공지능과 암호화폐에 수천억달러를 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 인공지능은 자동화를 통해 인간의 관여를 축소하고, 힘을 집중시키고, 독재를 강화하고, 중산층을 약화시키는 것을 목표로 합니다. 투기적인 암호화폐, 중독적인 소셜미디어, 그리고 현실도피적인 "메타버스"는 사회구조(social fabric)를 약화시키고, 분열을 조장하고, 인포데믹(infodemic)을 퍼뜨리고, 범죄를 확산시켜왔습니다. 이러한 기술에 투자해온 나라들이 민주주의와 기술을 서로 적으로 인식하는 것은 전혀 놀랍지 않습니다. 이러한 접근은 사회구조에 위해를 가할 뿐만 아니라 물리적 공간의(physical universe) 기본구조, 그리고 우리가 딛고 사는 이 땅에도 영향을 미칩니다. 이는 물리세계의 양자적 특성이 다원성의 원칙에 따라 움직이고 있다는 것이 최근 밝혀졌고, 우리의 지구는 생태적 다양성으로 가득차 있는 곳이기 때문입니다.  

그러나 이러한 흐름을 바꾸기에 아직 늦지 않았습니다. 우리는 디지털 인권을 확립하고, 다원주의를 강화하며, 민주적인 사회에 적합한 기술에 투자할 수 있으며, 권위주의와 초자본주의(hyper-capitalism)의 성과를 넘어설 수 있습니다. 새로운 분산신원인증기술(DID)을 통해 모든 사람에게 빼앗을 수 없는 고유한 디지털 인격(digital personhood)을 부여함으로써 중앙화된 감시 없이 여행하고, 거래하고, 사업을 수행하고, 민주적 커뮤니티에 참여할 수 있도록 투자할 수 있습니다. 타운홀과 개방형 공공광장(public square)을 형성하는 커뮤니티 주도의 책임성 있는 소셜 네트워크와 원장(ledgers)들을 통해서 디지털 세상에서의 결사의 자유를 실현시킬 수 있고, 점점 커지고 있는 있는 집단 간의 분열을 완화시킬 수 있습니다. 플랫폼 독점기업의 통제 없이 안전하고 개인정보가 보호된 상태로 데이터, 컴퓨팅 파워(computation), 저장공간을 공유하기 위해 고안된 암호화 기술을 사용하여 미래의 공공시장과 지역 경제(main streets)를 만들어냄으로서 디지털 재산권을 확보할 수 있습니다. 또한 정부가 지원하고, 개인정보가 보호되며, 국제적으로 상호운용가능한 디지털화폐로 상거래에 참여할 권리를 보장받을 수 있습니다. 그리고 초고속 인터넷을 기본 인권으로, 디지털 역량(digital competency) 교육을 공립 학교의 주요 교과 과정으로 보장하여 이러한 권리들을 모든 시민들이 누리도록 할 수 있습니다.

이러한 기본적인 디지털 인권을 보장하는 것은 디지털 세계에서 다원주의를 가능하게 할 뿐만 아니라 당연한 것으로 만듭니다. 대만에서는 "digital"과 "plural"에 같은 단어를 사용합니다: 數位. (다원주의와 디지털의 개념을 접목시켜온) 대만과 이와 유사한 생태계의 경험은 매우 초기이긴 하지만 이러한 토대가 민주주의 번영을 촉진한다는 것을 보여줬습니다. 안전하고 사적인 신원체계는 vTaiwan의 경우에서 알 수 있듯 시민들이 트롤(troll)과 봇(bot)의 방해에 휘둘리지 않고 사려 깊은 토의에 참여할 수 있도록 해줍니다. 개인간 데이터 공유가 가능해지면 독점 플랫폼에 의존하지 않고 이웃과 지역사회가 꼭 필요한 서비스(예를 들어, 오염 정보나 마스크 지도)를 누릴 수 있습니다. 개방적이면서도 신뢰할 수 있는 지급결제시스템은 불필요한 관료주의 없이 공유자원 사용을 효과적으로 지원하는 혁신적인 크라우드 펀딩을 가능하게 할 것입니다. P2P 기반 평판 체계는 시민사회가 정보의 왜곡에 (종종 유머로) 맞대응할 힘을 부여하며 이를 통해 역동적이고 개방적인 의견 표명이 가능하게 합니다. 양자컴퓨터가 다른 기술적 패러다임에 비해 특히 Plurality를 지원하기에더 적합하다는 점이 점점 드러나고 있다는 점에서, 이러한 가능성에 부응하는 투자가 이루어진다면 (우리가 그리는) 대담한 미래는 그리 멀지 않았습니다.

이러한 도구들은 (일차적으로는) 전 세계의 공공부문을 변혁시킬 수 있지만 그 적용이 단지 국가 혹은 공공 차원의 민주주의 증진에만 제한되는 것은 아닙니다. 이 기술은 교회에서부터 회사에 이르는 모든 조직체가 더 생산적이고 역동적인 협업을 이끌어 낼 수 있는 방법을 제시합니다. 기업들은 그 어느때보다도 내부기업가정신(intrapreneurship)과 부서간 (협업) 인프라를 촉진시킬 수 있습니다. 사적 데이터의 자주적인 공유(private and sovereign data sharing)는 질병을 억제하고 치료할 수 있습니다. 새로운 미디어 환경은 그 어느때보다 신뢰성이 높아지는 동시에 (합의가 필요한) 핵심 사실에 대해서는 컨센서스를 이룰 수 있게 되며, 소외되어 왔던 목소리에 힘을 실어 줄 것입니다. 따라서, 인터넷이 그것을 처음 만든 군대나 대학만을 위해 존재하지 않았듯이, Plurality도 단지 정치나 정부를 위한 것은 아닙니다. Plurality는 우리가 어떻게 활용할 지를 잘 배우기만 한다면 모든 부문과 모든 개인의 삶을 더 낫게 변화시켜주는 새로운 기술 패러다임이 될 것입니다.

그러나 한편으로는 인터넷과 다른 변혁적인 기술들이 그랬듯, Plurality도 우리가 투자하는 정도에 따라 그 성패가 결정될 것입니다. 인터넷은 새로운 분산형 사용자 인터페이스 디자인을 실험하기 위해 미 국방부의 ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency)가 만들어낸 네트워크로부터 시작되었습니다. 그러나 Plurality가 많은 부분 따르고 있기도한 ARPANET 설립자(JCR Licklider)의 비전은 극히 부분적으로만 실현되었는데, 대중적이고 국제적인 지지와 다양한 부문의 투자를 이끌어 내는데 실패했기 때문입니다. 대신, Licklider가 예상하기도 했듯 인터넷의 혜택은 그 잠재력을 훼손시키는 독점기업들이 대부분 누리게 되었습니다. 지금 우리는 과거의 실수를 바로 잡고, 기술이 우리의 가장 높은 이상을 격하시키는 것이 아니라, 오히려 구체화하고 강화시켜주는 새로운 미래를 건설할 수 있는 기회를 마주하고 있습니다. 모든 사회활동가, 예술가, 기술자, 시민, 정책입안자, 그리고 모든 조직체가 이 미래를 실현시키기 위한 투쟁에서 중요한 역할을 해야만 합니다.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Plurality (다원성)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        다원성의 세계에서 살기 (15쪽): 양자역학의 가장 기본적인 물질 단위로부터 가장 높은 곳의 수준에 이르기까지, “아름다움, 성장, 진보는 – 모두 서로 다른 것들의 연합의 결과.” (스타트렉 인용구). 그러므로 이 모든 성취는 다양성을 지켜내고 장려하는데 달려 있으며, 차이를 넘어 커뮤니케이션과 협력을 강화하는 것이 중요함. 정보통신기술은 사회적 상호작용의 동적 양상을 매핑하여, 이러한 네트워크를 포괄하는 새로운 연결과 및 조직을 만들어낼 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        잃어버린 DAO (15쪽):  Henry George, Georg Simmel, John Dewey와 같은 사회학자, 경제학자 및 철학자들의 이론은 개인과 사회집단이 역동적으로 관계를 맺는 네트워크 사회에 대한 단초를 제시. 이 비전은 인터넷 구현의 토대가 되었으나, 한번도 철학적으로 명확히 정의된 적이 없기 때문에 잊혀지거나 다른 철학으로 대체되었으며, 인터넷의 이상은 단지 인간 지능의 모방이나 사회적 유대(또는 구속)로부터의 개인의 해방에 초점을 두게 되었음. 이 책은 그 잃어버린 비전을 회복하고 어떻게 성취할 수 있는지 보여주고, 그 비전을 확장해 나갈수 있는 길을 제시하는 것을 목표로 함.
      </li>
      <li>
        위산(玉山)에서의 전망 (20쪽): 대만은 지리적으로는 유라시아 대륙판과 아메리카 대륙판의 교차점에 위치하며, 이념적으로는 중국식 중앙집권적 인공지능과 미국식 초자본주의 이데올로기, 그리고 유럽식 가치기반 규제국가 이념이 만나는 곳에 자리함. 단층선이 대만 최고점인 위산(玉山)을 더 높이 밀어올리듯 이념간의 긴장은 대만이 기술적으로 뛰어나면서도 세계에서 가장 민주적인 나라 중의 하나가 되도록 하는 다원주의적 통합을 발전시켰음. 이번 장에서는 다양한 관점에서 대만의 디지털 민주주의의 일상을 생생하고 감동적으로 전달. 장관, 시민 운동가, 사업가, 디지털 기술이 생소한 일반인 등등의 관점을 포함. 대만의 디지털 민주주의가 어떻게 생겨났고 다른 자유민주주의 국가들과의 유사점과 차이점을 제시.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Freedom (자유)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        운영체제로서의 인권(5쪽): 산업 민주주의가 보편적 인권의 확립을 기반으로 세워졌듯 디지털 민주주의도 디지털 영역의 보편적인 인권 보장이 중요. 현재 이러한 권리는 매우 제한적이고 독점적으로만 확보될 수 있어 Plurality의 잠재력을 해치고 있음. 이 섹션의 각 장은 디지털 인권 실현을 가능하게 할 상호작용에 대한 간략한 윤곽을 제시하는 것으로 시작.
      </li>
      <li>
        인격 (10쪽): 생존권, 이동권, 정체성에 대한 권리 등 가장 기본적인 권리를 온라인 상에서 구현시키기 위해 필요한 신원인증시스템은 소수의 독점 플랫폼이 통제하고 있음. 현재 Web3의 세계에서 부각되고 있는 탈중앙화 되어있고 다원주의적인 신원인증체계는, 과거 인터넷이 전통적 소통방식을 훨씬 뛰어넘은 것처럼, 현재 상태의 인터넷을 훨씬 능가하도록 해줄 수 있는 일련의 새로운 기능들을 만들어낼 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        연결(Association) (10쪽): 소셜 네트워크는 디지털시대의 연결 가능성을 구체화(map)시키고, 블록체인은 디지털시대의 공공광장(public square)을 제공. 공익목적 투자를 통해 이들이 제공하는 평판시스템(reputation)과 사회적 유대의 질이 높일 수 있다면 사회적 관계가 더 확장될 수 있으며, 전통적으로 익명의 시장 교환(anomymous market exchange)에 할당되어 있던 수많은 기능들이 대체할 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        상거래 (5쪽): 합법적인 기관(중앙은행, 정부, 민간 은행 등)의 개입을 통해 디지털화폐가 주권보장과 개인정보보호는 물론 초국가적 상호운용성의 혜택을 보장할 수 있으며, 암호화폐가 유발한 혼란과 현재 지급시장을 지배하고 있는 비효율적인 독점의 폐해들로부터 지급결제시스템을 해방시킬 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        재산권 (10쪽): 디지털 세상의 기본이 되는 자산(데이터, 컴퓨팅 파워, 메모리)은 분산화된 방식으로 만들어지지만, 이들을 안전하게 공유할 공개 표준의 부재로 인해 소수의 빅테크회사들에 그 힘이 집중되어있음. 이 부문에서 개방형 표준을 개발하기 위한 공공투자는 시민사회와 여러 사업체들이 더 큰 신뢰, 개인정보보호, 그리고 자주권을 갖고 (디지털 시대의 필수 자산에 대한) 새로운 재산권 확립을 위한 협력을 가능하게 해줌.
      </li>
      <li>
        접근성과 교육 (5쪽): 온라인 인권은 사이버 공간에 접속하고 이를 다룰 수 있는 사람에게만 해당. 따라서 초고속 브로드밴드 이용권과 단순 문해력을 넘어선 디지털 역량 교육이 보편적인 인권으로 받아들여져야 함.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Democracy (민주주의)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        애플리케이션으로서의 민주주의 (10쪽): 민주적 제도는 이러한 기반 위에서 작동할 수 있는 애플리케이션이며 세 가지 기본 요소를 가짐:  숙의(deliberation), 타협(compromise), 다원주의(pluralism). 이러한 제도는 공공 및 민간 부문을 변화시키며, 이에 따라 자금의 조달과 사업의 수행이 모두 민주적 방법을 따르게 됨. 각 장은 오늘날 디지털 민주주의를 달성하기 위해 기술이 활용되는 방식을 소개하는 짧은 글로 시작.
      </li>
      <li>
        숙의 (5쪽): 통계의 발달은 (종종 인공지능의 도움으로) 수많은 의견의 핵심을 습득하는 “광범위한 경청”을 가능하게 함으로써 대규모의 민주적 숙의(deliveration)를 가능하게 함.
      </li>
      <li>
        타협 (5쪽): 메커니즘 설계의 발전은 (종종 Web3와 연계되어) 넓은 범위의 타협 및 호혜적 거래가 가능하도록 하며, 다수의 횡포와 같은 함정에 빠지지 않는 직접 민주주의를 실현시킬 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        다원주의 (5쪽): 소셜네트워크가 사회의 분열을 제대로 파악(trace)하도록 함으로써 “로컬” 커뮤니티가 자주적으로 운영되도록(self-govern)하고, 분쟁 해소를 위한 인센티브를 적극적으로 만들어 낼 수 있는 권한을 부여.
      </li>
      <li>
        금융 (5쪽): Web3 커뮤니티로부터 촉발된 새로운 형태의 사회조직은 대규모의 민주적 서비스를 제공하는 하나의 새로운 사회 부문으로 발전하여 시장-국가 간 분열을 극복.

    <ol>
      <li>
        미디어 (5쪽): 쉽게 예상하기 어려운 합의에 이른 컨텐츠를 밝혀내는(surface) 알고리즘, 그리고 (종종 유머를 활용하는) 시민사회 그룹의 적극적인 참여로 표현의 자유를 보장함으로써 정보왜곡에 대응할 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        보건 (5쪽): 희소한 보건자원의 효과적인 배분과 감염경로의 표적화를 가능하게 하는 의료체계가 서둘러 만들어진다면 전염병 및 여타 공중보건위기를 적시에 식별하고, 비용효율적으로 대응할 수 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        환경 (5쪽): 개개인이 수평적인 “데이터 연합(data coalitions)”을 구축함으로써 프라이버시의 침해 없이 모든 규모의 환경위해(environmental hamrs)를 빠르게 분별할 수 있음. 시민들의 “데이터 연합”은  정부와 커뮤니티 구성원이 환경문제에 대한 책무를 수행하도록 촉구할 수 있는 힘을 확보.
      </li>
      <li>
        일자리 (5쪽): 사람의 대체(replacement)가 아닌 사람의 관여(engagement)를 위한 디지털 기술을 촉진함으로써 더 나은 일자리를 만들고, 보편적으로 공유되는 번영과 참여를 유도.

        제도(Institutions) (20쪽):  Plurality를 실현시키기 위해서는 대규모 투자가 필요하며, 이 자금은 국익이나 사익의 추구, 또는 자선(charity)등 모든 투자 동기(motives)를 포괄하는 한편 극복해내기 위해 다양한 (산업)부문과 국가들이 참여하는 방식으로 조달되어야 함. 또한 다양한 지역단위 커뮤니티에서의 실험은 국제규모로도 실현 가능하도록 표준화 작업과 밀접하게 연계되어야 하며, 이 때 각국의 (대만에 존재하는 것과 같은) 디지털 장관들이 네트워크를 형성하는 방식 등을 활용할 수 있음. 민간 기업, 학계, 자선단체, 그리고 사회운동 단체들이 모두 새로운 개방형 표준 정립에 기여했을 때 얻을 수 있는 비전과 명성의 성취에 이끌려 이 작업에 참여할 수 있어야 함. 일견 야심차 보이는 이 계획은 ARPANET의 펀딩을 받던 사용자 연구 실험실들의 네트워크에 의해 촉발되었던 인터넷의 역사를 현재의 다극화된 세계에까지 연장하는 의미를 가지고 있음.
      </li>
      <li>
        행동(10쪽): 우리의 이상이 최종적으로 성공하기 위해서는 최고위급에서의 조정과 협력이 필요하나, 개별 시민 역시 추진력을 만들어 내기 위해 해야할 역할이 있음. 우리는 해커, 투자자, 사업가, 사회운동가, 예술가, 투표권자 등 모든 사람들이 어떻게 이 운동의 일원이 되어 도구(기술)가 우리를 지배하는 것이 아니라 우리의 가치 구현을 돕도록 할 수 있는지 보여줄 것임.

Une introduction et un appel à la coopération pour la rédaction du texte - *Pluralisme: Technologie pour une diversité coopérative et démocratique.*

Audrey Tang, E. Glen Weyl

*French translation by Daniel Alsterholm*

Nous sommes sur le chemin, depuis déjà une demi-décennie et avec le soutien de plusieurs de vous-mêmes, à développer une alternative aux récits prédominants sur le futur de la technologie trop centré sur le monde de la finance et l'intelligence artificielle centralisée. *Pluralité*, comme nous l'appelons, est la technologie qui reconnaît, met en valeur, habilite et renforce la coopération à travers des différences sociales et culturelles. Ci-dessous suit un résumé qui vous offre les principales lignes de cette idée. Nous croyons que la pluralité est le paradigme technologique naturel pour soutenir l'épanouissement des sociétés démocratiques et peut surmonter bon nombre des divisions enracinées dans notre monde d'aujourd'hui. Nous voulons informer le monde de cette possibilité afin de stimuler les investissements et les expérimentations divers et coordonnés qui peuvent en faire une réalité.
Et nous aurions besoin d’un coup de main.

Alors que notre plan précis évoluera avec les progrès de la recherche sur la pluralité et des réalités pratiques, nous nous engageons à incarner les idées du livre dans la façon dont nous le créons, distribuons et soutenons financièrement. Tout le matériel sera une œuvre pro bono ("Free Cultural Work"),  une catégorie parmi les plus permissives de la licence "Creative Commons". Nous prévoyons d'écrire le livre en public dans une structure de type git, où nous sollicitons ouvertement l'assistance éditoriale et de recherche de la communauté et engagerons ceux qui contribuent à nous aider à hiérarchiser les demandes d'extraction et éventuellement à contrôler le contenu du livre. Nous prendrons en charge les dépenses financières liées à la mise à disposition du livre à l'aide d'une gamme de mécanismes alignés et natifs du web3, y compris les subventions de financement pluriel/quadratique, les « signatures » NFT sur les copies achetées physiques et numériques du livre et les NFT SALSA/Harberger pour l'accès à Glen en tant que conférencier/consultant basé sur le livre. Nous représenterons une gamme de rôles contribuant au livre à l'aide de Soulbound Tokens (SBT) et les utiliserons comme base pour gouverner les choix concernant le contenu après la publication physique, y compris la disposition d'une grande partie des fonds collectés, convertissant à peu près la communauté du livre en une organisation autonome distribuée (DAO). Nous travaillerons en étroite collaboration avec Protocol Labs (PL) pour construire le substrat technologique pour que cela fonctionne et, espérons-le, aider à inventer un nouveau modèle de publication pour l'ère du Web3.

En même temps, en tant que pluralistes, nous ne voulons pas toucher uniquement les "natifs du web3", et à ce titre nous espérons en faire un véritable livre, beau à regarder, largement accessible, diffusé et revu dans les canaux éditoriaux et médiatiques standards. Ainsi, nous avons besoin non seulement de hackers et d'écrivains, mais aussi de designers, de raconteurs, de spécialistes du marketing, de traducteurs, d'éditeurs, etc. pour travailler avec nous. Et nous comprenons que certains d'entre eux préféreront davantage de droits individuels aux droits de gouvernance sur les flux de trésorerie potentiels spéculatifs, des possibilités que nous sommes ouverts à négocier avec des partenaires qui partagent nos objectifs et notre vision dans d'autres dimensions. Dans tous les cas, ni Audrey ni Glen ne recevront de compensation ou des redevances pour leur travail sur le texte, pour se conformer aux responsabilités légales associées à leur emploi et pour s'assurer que tout revenu soutient notre mission et la communauté que nous espérons construire.

Nous lancerons bientôt la plate-forme logicielle qui prendra en charge notre écriture en public et la gestion de la participation, mais si vous percevez une manière dont vous souhaitez contribuer avant cela, n'hésitez pas à [écrire à Glen](mailto:glen@radicalxchange.org). L'avenir de la technologie peut honorer et soutenir les valeurs qui nous sont chères si nous travaillons ensemble pour l'imaginer et l'expliquer.

<h2>APERÇU</h2>

La technologie et la démocratie sont en guerre: la technologie renforce la surveillance autoritaire et corrode les institutions démocratiques, tandis que les démocraties ripostent avec une réglementation contraignante et le conservatisme du secteur public. Pourtant ce conflit n'est-il pas inévitable ? C'est notre choix d'investir dans des technologies anti-démocratiques, telles que l'intelligence artificielle (IA) et les crypto-monnaies. Quelques endroits, comme la communauté Ethereum, l'Estonie, l'État du Colorado et surtout Taïwan, se sont plutôt concentrés sur des technologies qui permettent une collaboration diversifiée et ont vu la démocratie et la technologie prospérer ensemble. Ce livre, rédigé par les leaders de ce nouveau paradigme de la pluralité, montre pour la première fois comment chaque technologue, décideur politique, chef d'entreprise et activiste peut l'exploiter pour construire un monde plus collaboratif, diversifié et productivement démocratique.

Lorsque Uber est arrivé à Taïwan, sa présence était source de division, tout comme elle l'a été dans une grande partie du monde. Mais plutôt que les réseaux sociaux ne jettent de l'huile sur le feu, la plate-forme vTaiwan, que l'une de nous a développée en tant que ministre dans ce pays, a permis aux citoyens à s'exprimer sur la question et d'avoir une conversation réfléchie et délibérée avec des milliers de participants sur la façon dont le covoiturage devrait être réglementé. Cette technologie exploite des outils statistiques souvent associés à l'IA pour regrouper les opinions, permettant à chaque participant de digérer rapidement l'articulation la plus claire des points de vue de ses concitoyens et d'apporter ses propres réflexions. Les points de vue qui ont attiré le soutien de toutes les lignes de division initiales ont atteint le sommet, formant un consensus approximatif qui a assuré les avantages des nouveaux outils de covoiturage tout en protégeant les droits des travailleurs et a été mis en œuvre par le gouvernement. Ce processus a été utilisé pour résoudre des dizaines de problèmes litigieux à Taïwan et se répand rapidement dans le monde entier auprès des gouvernements, des coopératives et des communautés blockchain.

Pourtant, vTaiwan ne fait qu'effleurer la façon dont la technologie peut être conçue pour percevoir, honorer et combler les différences sociales pour la collaboration; les nouvelles règles de vote et de financement issues de l'écosystème Ethereum peuvent remodeler la façon dont nous gouvernons les secteurs public et privé; les mondes virtuels immersifs renforcent les connexions empathiques qui traversent les frontières de l'exclusion sociale; les réseaux sociaux et les flux d'actualités peuvent être conçus pour renforcer la cohésion sociale et la création de sens partagés, plutôt que de nous séparer. Et, comme l'expérience de Taïwan met en evidence, les avantages sociaux potentiels sont vastes, permettant la meilleure réponse mondiale à une série de crises récentes, de la pandémie de Covid à la désinformation en passant par la création d'une prospérité largement partagée.

Pourtant, alors que quelques pays et écosystèmes ont investi des dizaines de millions de dollars dans ces technologies, le reste du monde a investi des centaines de milliards dans l'IA et la cryptographie, qui poursuivent des objectifs fondamentalement différents. L'IA vise à automatiser la participation humaine, à centraliser le pouvoir, à renforcer les autocraties et à saper la classe moyenne. Les crypto-monnaies spéculatives, les réseaux sociaux addictifs et les "métaverses" d'évasion ont miné le tissu social, renforcé les divisions sociales, propagé une infodémie et proliféré la criminalité. Il n'est donc pas surprenant que les pays qui ont investi dans ces technologies voient la démocratie et la technologie comme des ennemis.

Mais il n'est pas trop tard pour changer de voie: nous pouvons investir dans des technologies qui établissent les droits humains numériques, renforcent le pluralisme et s'épanouissent dans les sociétés démocratiques, leur permettant de surpasser l'autoritarisme et l'hypercapitalisme. Nous pouvons investir pour permettre à chaque personne de faire valoir son droit inaliénable à pouvoir prouver son identité grâce à une nouvelle génération de technologies d'identité décentralisée (DID) qui permettent à chaque personne de voyager, d'effectuer des transactions, de faire des affaires et de participer à des communautés démocratiques sans surveillance centralisée. Nous pouvons concrétiser la liberté d'association dans le monde numérique avec des réseaux sociaux et des registres gérés par la communauté et responsables qui forment les mairies et les places publiques du futur tout en comblant les clivages croissants entre les groupes. Nous pouvons sécuriser les droits de propriété numérique en créant les marchés publics et les rues principales du futur avec des technologies cryptographiques pour le partage sécurisé et préservant la confidentialité des données, des calculs et du stockage entre pairs, sans le contrôle des monopoles de plateforme. Nous pouvons garantir le droit de négocier avec des monnaies numériques soutenues par le gouvernement, préservant la confidentialité et interopérables à l'échelle internationale. Et nous pouvons permettre à chaque citoyen d'accéder à ces droits en faisant de l'internet à haut débit un élément central de l'enseignement des droits de l'homme et des compétences numériques dans les programmes scolaires publics.

La sécurisation de ces droits humains numériques fondamentaux rend le pluralisme dans le monde numérique non seulement possible, mais naturel. A Taïwan, les caractères idéographiques pour « numérique » et « pluriel » sont les mêmes : 數位. L'expérience là-bas et dans des écosystèmes similaires a montré comment ces fondations, même sous une forme naissante, favorisent une démocratie florissante. Les identités sécurisées et privées permettent aux citoyens de participer à des délibérations réfléchies et à des compromis raisonnés, comme à vTaiwan, sans faire face à des attaques de trolls et de bots. Le partage de données privées permet aux quartiers et aux communautés de fournir des services (de la surveillance de la pollution aux cartes de disponibilité des masques) pour eux-mêmes plutôt que de s'appuyer sur des plateformes propriétaires. Des paiements ouverts et fiables permettent des formes créatives de financement participatif pour soutenir les biens partagés sans lourdeur bureaucratique. Les systèmes de réputation pair-à-pair permettent à la société civile de lutter contre la désinformation, souvent avec humour, tout en maintenant un discours dynamique et ouvert.

De plus, si ces outils peuvent transformer le secteur public dans le monde, ils ne sont pas seulement pertinents ni même principalement pertinents pour les démocraties nationales. Au lieu de cela, ils offrent à chaque organisation, des églises aux entreprises, un moyen de favoriser une coopération plus productive et dynamique. Les entreprises peuvent renforcer l'intrapreneuriat et l'infrastructure interdivision plus rapidement que jamais. Le partage de données privées et souveraines peut contenir et guérir des maladies. Un nouveau paysage médiatique peut simultanément être plus digne de confiance et plus consensuel sur les faits clés que jamais auparavant tout en autonomisant les voix marginalisées par les gardiens traditionnels. La pluralité n'est donc pas réservée à la politique et au gouvernement, pas plus qu'Internet ne l'était aux militaires et aux universités qui l'ont construite. Au lieu de cela, il s'agit d'un nouveau paradigme technologique qui peut transformer chaque secteur et la vie de chaque individu pour le mieux si nous apprenons à l'exploiter.

Mais tout comme Internet et d'autres technologies transformatrices, la pluralité ne prospérera que dans la mesure où nous y investirons. Internet a commencé comme un réseau établi par l'Agence des projets de recherche avancée du Département de la défense des États-Unis (ARPANET) pour expérimenter de nouvelles conceptions d'interface utilisateur décentralisées. Pourtant, la vision des fondateurs d'ARPANET, comme JCR Licklider, sur laquelle la nôtre est étroitement calquée, n'a été que très partiellement réalisée car elle n'a jamais mobilisé le soutien public et international et les investissements multisectoriels nécessaires pour la mener à bien. Au lieu de cela, comme l'avait prédit Licklider, il a été principalement capturé par des monopoles qui ont entravé son potentiel. Aujourd'hui, nous avons la possibilité de corriger cette erreur et de construire un avenir où nos technologies expriment et renforcent nos idéaux les plus élevés, plutôt que de les dégrader. Chaque activiste, artiste, technologue, citoyen, décideur politique et organisation a un rôle clé à jouer dans la lutte pour cet avenir.

<div class="markdown markdown-sm italic text-center mt-12 mb-12">

Quand on voit "l'internet des objets", faisons-en un internet des êtres.

Quand nous voyons la “réalité virtuelle”, faisons-en une réalité partagée.

Quand nous voyons "machine learning", faisons-en un apprentissage collaboratif.

Quand on parle d'"expérience utilisateur", parlons d'expérience humaine.

Quand nous entendons « la singularité est proche », rappelons-nous : la pluralité est là.

<h2>PLAN DE L'OUVRAGE</h2>

Vous trouverez ci-dessous un plan divisé en parties et chapitres. Chaque chapitre répertorie la longueur de page estimée et donne un résumé de l'argument du chapitre concerné, dans une proportion d'environ une phrase pour 5 pages. Tout cela est une première esquisse.

      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Introduction : La guerre entre la démocratie et la technologie</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(10 pages):</p>
    </div> Les conflits qui font la une des journaux entre la technologie et la démocratie reflètent et cachent à la fois une tension plus profonde entre les directions que la technologie a développées et les principes d'une société démocratique. Alors que les technologies spécifiques issues des traditions de l'IA et du web3 ont un potentiel important, ce sont fondamentalement des idéologies politiques antidémocratiques plutôt que des technologies, vouées respectivement à la centralisation du pouvoir et à l'individualisme extrême.

      <li>
        Vivre dans un monde pluriel (15 pages) : Du niveau physique le plus élémentaire de la mécanique quantique aux plus hauts sommets, "la beauté, la croissance, le progrès - tous résultent de l'union de la différence". (citation de Star Trek). Tout cela dépend donc du maintien et de la prolifération de la diversité, tout en renforçant la communication et la coopération au-delà des différences. Les technologies de l'information et des communications peuvent cartographier le paysage dynamique des relations sociales et faciliter de nouvelles connexions et organisations qui couvrent ces réseaux.
      </li>
      <li>
        La Dao perdue (15 pages) L'idée d'une société en réseau, où les individus et les groupes sociaux sont à la fois des intersections dynamiques les uns des autres, trouve son origine dans les théories de sociologues, d'économistes et de philosophes comme Henry George, Georg Simmel et John Dewey. Cette vision a été le fondement de ce qui est devenu Internet, mais n'a jamais été articulée avec une clarté philosophique, ce qui lui a permis d'être oubliée et remplacée par d'autres philosophies, axées sur l'imitation de l'intelligence humaine ou la libération des individus des liens sociaux. Ce livre vise à retrouver cette vision perdue, à montrer comment elle a réussi et peut réussir et à tracer la voie à suivre pour qu'elle s'épanouisse.
      </li>

        Une vue de Yu Shan (20 pages) Taïwan se situe à l'intersection des plaques continentales de l'Eurasie et de l'Amérique, et à l'intersection idéologique de l'idéologie centralisée chinoise de l'IA, de l'idéologie hyper-capitaliste américaine et des États régulateurs européens fondés sur les valeurs. Comme la ligne de faille physique a poussé le point culminant de Taïwan, Yu Shan, plus haut, ces tensions idéologiques ont poussé Taïwan à développer une synthèse pluraliste qui lui a permis de devenir le pays le plus technologiquement avancé et le plus activement démocratique du monde. Ce chapitre donnera un portrait vivant et émouvant de la vie dans la démocratie numérique taïwanaise sous plusieurs angles : celui du ministre, celui d'un militant civique, celui d'un citoyen ordinaire désengagé du numérique, celui d'un homme d'affaires, etc. Il racontera également brièvement l'histoire de l'émergence de la démocratie numérique à Taiwan, établissant des parallèles et des contrastes avec les circonstances d'autres pays démocratiques libéraux aujourd'hui.

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Liberté</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Les droits de l'homme comme système d'exploitation (5 pages) Tout comme les démocraties industrielles sont construites sur le fondement des droits de l'homme universels, les démocraties numériques dépendent de la défense universelle des droits de l'homme dans le domaine numérique. L'accès à ces fonctionnalités est, actuellement, limité et exclusif, ce qui compromet le potentiel de la Pluralité. Chaque chapitre de cette section commencera par une brève esquisse d'une interaction que la réalisation de ce droit permettra.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personnalité (10 pages) Les droits à la vie, au voyage et à la reconnaissance personnelle sont les droits les plus fondamentaux et pourtant les systèmes d'identité qui les rendent possibles en ligne sont contrôlés par quelques plateformes propriétaires. Les systèmes d'identité décentralisés et pluralistes qui émergent actuellement de l'espace Web3 peuvent permettre une gamme de nouvelles fonctionnalités qui emmènent Internet aussi loin au-delà de son état actuel qu'Internet a pris les modes de communication antérieurs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Association (10 pages) Les réseaux sociaux cartographient l'association à l'ère numérique, tandis que les blockchains fournissent l'équivalent numérique des places publiques. Si ceux-ci peuvent être étendus par des investissements d'intérêt public pour enrichir la réputation et les relations sociales qu'ils véhiculent, ils ont le potentiel d'étendre la portée des relations sociales bien au-delà d'aujourd'hui et de se substituer à de nombreuses fonctions traditionnellement attribuées à l'échange anonyme sur le marché.
      </li>
      <li>
        Commerce (5 pages) Avec la participation d'institutions légitimes (telles que les banques centrales, les gouvernements et les banques), les monnaies numériques peuvent avoir une structure de réseau qui permet à la fois les avantages de la souveraineté et de la confidentialité et de l'interopérabilité internationale, libérant les paiements du chaos des crypto-monnaies mais, au même temps, aussi des monopoles inefficaces qui dominent actuellement les paiements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Propriété (10 pages) Alors que les actifs fondamentaux du monde numérique (données, calcul et mémoire) sont créés de manière distribuée, le manque de normes ouvertes pour les partager en toute sécurité a concentré le pouvoir dans quelques grandes entreprises technologiques. L'investissement public dans le développement de normes ouvertes pour un partage sécurisé dans ces domaines permettra à la société civile et aux groupes d'entreprises de parvenir à une collaboration beaucoup plus ambitieuse, plus efficace, avec plus de confiance, de confidentialité et de souveraineté.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accès et éducation (5 pages) Les droits de l'homme en ligne ne concernent que ceux qui peuvent accéder et naviguer dans le cyberspace. L'accès à l'internet à haut débit et à la compétence numérique, et non seulement la connaissance de ses éléments, doivent, donc, faire partie des droits humains universels.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-weight:bold">Démocratie</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        La démocratie en tant qu'applications (10 pages) Les institutions démocratiques sont des applications qui peuvent fonctionner sur ces fondations et ont trois composantes fondamentales : la délibération, le compromis et le pluralisme. Ces institutions peuvent non seulement transformer le secteur public mais aussi le secteur privé, démocratiser les entreprises, et dépendre à leur tour de ces modèles de financement démocratisés. Chaque chapitre commencera par une vignette des façons dont les technologies sont utilisées aujourd'hui pour parvenir à la démocratie numérique.
      </li>
      <li>
        Délibération (5 pages) Les progrès des statistiques (souvent associées à l'IA) permettent une "large écoute", où des millions de personnes peuvent entendre l'essence distillée de la distribution de l'opinion de leurs pairs, permettant une délibération démocratique à grande échelle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compromis (5 pages) Les avancées dans la conception des mécanismes (souvent associés au web3) rendent possibles les compromis et les marchandages à grande échelle, permettant une démocratie directe qui ne tombe pas dans les pièges de la tyrannie de la majorité.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pluralisme (5 pages) Les réseaux sociaux nous permettent de retracer les clivages et les divisions sociales, nous permettant à la fois de donner aux communautés "locales" les moyens de s'autogouverner et de créer activement des incitations à combler ces clivages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finance (5 pages) Les nouvelles formes d'organisation sociale émergeant de la communauté web3 nous permettent de dépasser le clivage marché-État en créant un secteur social émergent capable de fournir des services démocratiques à grande échelle.

      <p style="font-weight:bold; display:inline-block">Impact</p><p style="display:inline-block">&nbsp;(Intro 5 pages):</p>
    </div> La démocratie a acquis une mauvaise réputation dans une grande partie du monde pour son incapacité à relever les défis mondiaux critiques. Ceci à cause de ne pas réussir à tenir le rythme avec le développement de la technologie. Dans ce cas, l'expérience de Taiwan montre qu'il peut surpasser les régimes autoritaires. Chaque chapitre mettra en évidence des statistiques illustrant le succès possible dans des pays comme Taïwan et l'Estonie qui ont fait de la démocratie numérique une réalité.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Médias (5 pages) La désinformation peut être contenue tout en maintenant une liberté d'expression dynamique avec des algorithmes qui font apparaître le contenu avec un consensus surprenant et une participation active des groupes de la société civile qui exploitent l'humour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Santé (5 pages) Les pandémies et autres crises de santé publique peuvent être identifiées et traitées avec agilité et avec des coûts économiques minimes si la société civile peut rapidement concevoir des systèmes pour allouer les ressources sanitaires rares et cibler les chaînes de transmission.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environnement (5 pages) Les dommages environnementaux, du local au mondial, peuvent être rapidement identifiés sans envahir la vie privée si les citoyens peuvent former des « coalitions de données » horizontales, pouvant négocier avec les gouvernements pour assumer leurs responsabilités et s'assurer que les membres de la communauté font de même.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emplois (5 pages) En exploitant les technologies numériques pour l'engagement humain plutôt que pour le remplacement, les technologies numériques peuvent créer de meilleurs emplois qu'ils n'éclipsent, conduisant à une prospérité et à une participation naturellement largement partagées.
      </li>

        Institutions (20 pages) L'investissement à grande échelle nécessaire pour réaliser la pluralité nécessitera de fusionner des sources de financement de divers secteurs et pays pour combiner et transcender les motifs d'intérêt national, de profit et de charité. L'expérimentation avec diverses communautés dans de nombreux lieux géographiques devra être étroitement liée aux processus de standardisation, afin d'atteindre une échelle internationale. Ce travail pourrait, avec préférence, passer sous l'égide d'un réseau de ministres du numérique comme celui de Taïwan. Les entreprises du secteur privé, les institutions universitaires, les organisations caritatives et les militants devront tous être attirés par des contributions attirées par le prestige et la vision de l'avenir qui accompagnent la contribution à l'avenir des normes ouvertes. Bien qu'ambitieux, ce plan prolonge largement l'histoire de l'internet stimulée par le réseau de laboratoires de recherche utilisateurs financé par l'agence "Advanced Research Projects Agency" (ARPANET), l'étendant à notre monde multipolaire actuel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Action (10 pages) Alors que le succès nécessitera une coordination au plus haut niveau, chaque citoyen a un rôle à jouer pour créer l'élan nécessaire pour rendre cela possible. Nous montrerons comment les hackers, les investisseurs, les hommes d'affaires, les militants, les artistes, les électeurs peuvent tous faire partie d'un mouvement œuvrant pour que la Technologie serve nos valeurs plutôt que l'inverse.

**Decision:** RadicalxChange Agenda 2021-2022  
**Description:** What activities should the RadicalxChange Foundation prioritize in 2021-2022?

- This ballot was curated from the following [Pol.is conversation](https://pol.is/report/r5msrbdakwkcrej5ev7bk) by RadicalxChange Voice’s primary administrators: Alex Randaccio, Matt Prewitt, and Leon Erichsen. We encourage you to explore the linked Pol[]()is report to get a sense of which ideas achieved the strongest consensus, and which were divisive.
- We attempted to faithfully translate all of the ideas in the Pol[]()is comments into logically distinct, actionable ballot proposals.
- The numbers in brackets indicate the Pol[]()is comments that support each ballot proposal. We have included a brief explanation in cases where: (1) it was difficult or confusing to translate a comment into a proposal; (2) we consolidated substantially overlapping comments into a single proposal; or (3) we declined to incorporate the ideas in a comment in a ballot proposal (for example, because the comment was too vague to be actionable).

## Annotated ballot

1. Start a regular program (e.g. a series of livestreams, podcasts, and/or blog posts) inviting critiques of RxC ideas in an effort to refine them and avoid groupthink. [4]
2. Host online or physical opportunities for RxCers to meet one another. [17]
3. Support vibrant and independent chapters with diverse approaches to accomplishing RxC’s mission. [26]
4. Build stronger global connections between chapters. [34]
5. Support communities outside of RxC, especially ones led by and serving communities with marginalized experiences. [31]  
***We considered splitting this comment into two proposals, one focused on communities outside RxC in general and one focused on marginalized communities in particular.  However, the comment expresses a single coherent idea about how RxC should relate to other communities, so we have represented it as one proposal.***
6. Develop RxC software to facilitate pilots of RxC ideas by chapters and others. [51] [43]  
***We felt that comment 43 echoed the opinion in comment 51 that RxC should develop technologies.***
7. Invite people from adjacent communities to participate in RxC’s work (e.g. Complexity Weekend, Progress Studies, Effective Altruism). [30] [27]  
***Comments 27 and 30 both suggested that RxC should invite adjacent communities to participate in its work.***
8. Develop and refine RxC Voice with the aim of making it useful to other organizations, communities, or blockchain groups. [52] [61] [54] [63] [11] [66] [73]  
***Comments 61, 54, 63, 11, and 66 did not articulate a clear action for the RxC Foundation to take; however, comments 61, 54, 63, 11, and 66 did imply that the Foundation should refine the RxC Voice process. Comment 73 suggested that the Foundation make RxC Voice useful for other organizations, which we felt was included in comment 52.***
9. Support arts organizations in implementing RxC tools. [76]
10. Help businesses implement RxC ideas including by connecting them with legal experts. [5] [14]  
***We felt that comments 5 and 14 together expressed one coherent idea about how RxC should relate to businesses.***
11. Do more events where interested participants can discuss, not just "lecture" formats where only the experts speak. [9]
12. Support business plan competitions featuring RxC ideas (e.g. Quadratic Funding, “data dividends”) in order to strengthen the RxC ecosystem and accelerate the shift of RxC principles from theory to practice. [2] [1] [55]  
***We merged comments 1, 2, and 55 because they each suggested that RxC support business plan competitions featuring RxC ideas.***
13. Run public events that better embody democratic participation in order to reimagine democracy. [16]
14. Follow up with previous members of the RxC Fellowship Cohort to measure the impact of the Fellowship program. [7]

***We felt that comments 19, 33, and 50 each expressed that RxC should focus on producing media.***
16. Explore solutions outside of crypto/blockchain that relate to ideas identified in Radical Markets. [46] [40] [42]  
***Comments 40 and 42 did not articulate an explicit action for the RxC Foundation to take; however, they both implied that the Foundation should expand its activities outside of the crypto/blockchain space.***
17. Take a more active role in organizing RxC chapters around a cohesive vision. [41] [59]  
***Comment 59 did not articulate an explicit action for the RxC Foundation to take; however, we felt that comment 59 implied that the Foundation should take a more active role in supporting RxC chapters.***
18. Explore alternatives to traditional money and traditional cryptocurrencies in order to account for social and ecological outcomes. [8] [12]  
***We felt that comments 8 and 12 both suggested that RxC innovate and explore in the field of currency with the goal of optimizing on positive social and ecological outcomes.***
19. Create a central resource where chapters can request speakers on RxC topics. [80]
20. Produce quality presentations and podcasts focused on putting theory to practice. [24]
21. Experiment with RxC ideas in games (e.g. Minecraft, Monopoly) in order to educate people about public goods. [64]
22. Explore connections with rural communities. [57]
23. Collaborate with the “democratic workplace” ecosystem as part of RxC’s work on partial common ownership. [3]
24. Design RxC’s governance and communication structures to reflect the structures RxC wishes to build in society. [21] [20] [25]

28. Improve the user experience on the RxC website (e.g. reduce sensory overload on the home page, employ A/B testing). [78] [79]  
***Comment 78 gave a specific example of how RxC should improve the user experience on the website. Comment 79 suggested a method for doing so effectively. We felt that both suggested that RxC should improve the user experience on the website.***
29. Structure RadicalxChange like a community or network rather than an organization run by an in-group (e.g. change mission statement and execution). [58] [39]  
***We felt that comments 58 and 39 both suggested that RadicalxChange should be structured more like a community or network and less like a centralized organization. Each comment suggested an area to target in order to accomplish that same change.***
30. Hold regular, hands-on, practical workshops on using the various tools linked from the RxC website. [38]

43. Structure communication in the RxC network to reflect peer-to-peer values instead of more centralized organizational structures. [22] [15] [18] [67]  
***We felt that comments 15, 22, and 67 each suggested that RxC deemphasize polished and centralized formats of communication. We felt that comments 18, 22, and 67 explicitly suggested that RxC emphasize peer-to-peer communication as an alternative.***

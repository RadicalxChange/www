## What is PO?

Plural Ownership (PO) is a practical way to grant exclusive use of shared assets while keeping ongoing accountability to the public.

## What problem does it solve?

Traditional ownership places scarce resources like land, IP and stocks into long-term underuse or monopoly. That creates three common failures:

- **Hoarding & speculation:** Assets sit idle because selling would trigger taxes or because owners gamble on future appreciation.
- **Barriers to entry:** Newcomers can’t access valuable assets without deep pockets or political connections.
- **Missing public upside:** Communities create much of the value (infrastructure, safety, customers) but don’t share in rising rents.

PO works best where (1) exclusive use creates real value, (2) turnover/openness is desired, and (3) the community deserves a durable claim on rents or governance.

## How does it work?

The PO license, which grants exclusive use of the asset for a period of time, is sold periodically at auction. The winning bid goes to the outgoing steward (creating equity‑like value), and a recurring fee (e.g., 5% of that price) flows back to the community.

## How does this support more democratic outcomes?

- **Efficiency:** Assets circulate to those who can use them best.
- **Public revenue:** Fees rise with asset value, aligning private use with community benefit.
- **Accountability:** Periodic auctions prevent lock‑in.
- E**quity & access:** Because PO licenses are short-term and pay a fee to the community, their price at auction will be relatively low, broadening the number of possible participants.

## How has it been applied so far?

Early usage appears in digital art markets (pco.art) and blockchain games. Real‑world pilots remain limited; municipalities and community land entities are exploring PO licensing for storefronts and permits.

## What kind of organizations, governments or contexts can benefit from the application of this tool?

- **Local Governments & Communities:** For cities, associations, and other membership-based groups that own under-used assets, such as vacant land, PO offers an alternative to privatization that ensures more efficient use and development while also generating more sustainable revenue that can recirculate to fund public goods and infrastructure.
- **web3 & Decentralized Communities:** Crypto communities, pop-up villages, and related groups can use PO to more efficiently allocate scarce resources like land leases or IP while also generating more sustainable revenue that can recirculate to fund public goods and infrastructure.
- **Prosocial Media:** Large-scale online networks embracing “[prosocial media](https://www.noemamag.com/building-a-prosocial-media-ecosystem/)” can use PO to more efficiently allocate scare resources like advertising slots.

## What are the risks or costs?

- **Balance sheet effects**: Auction revenues flow to outgoing stewards rather than the city. Over time, however, this is more than offset by the rising fees associated with putting the asset to better use. Mitigation: **bridge financing via philanthropy or dedicated community development funds.
- **Investment incentives**: If licenses are too short or fees too high, investors won’t commit resources. Mitigation: **tune license length (e.g. 6–24 months), set modest fees, and ensure that outgoing stewards capture auction payments.

## What resources are required to implement?

- **Policy design**: Setting the parameters of the stewardship licenses and auctions.
- **Legal counsel**: Adaptation of concession/lease laws to license model.
- **Auction platform**: A transparent, recurring platform to run PO auctions.
- **Financial modeling**: Projections of public revenue vs. forgone asset sale proceeds; possible philanthropic backstop.

## How can RxC support the application of this tool in a new context?

RadicalxChange can:

- Provide **ready-to-go templates** (auction rules, license contracts).
- Convene **partners**: legal experts, civic tech platforms, philanthropic funders to underwrite pilots.
- Supply **simulation tools** that show projected revenue streams under different fee and license terms.
- Help **message and educate** the public: framing PO as a democratic alternative to privatization.

## Are there opportunities for alignment with identify verification, soulbound tokens or other technologies?

Because PO licenses are anchored in particular communities, identity tools are crucial:

- **Identity verification** can help ensure that stewardship rights rotate among real community members.
- **Soulbound tokens** can track community reputation, giving weight to proven stewards without allowing any resale or transfer.
- **Blockchain-based registries** can make license transfers transparent and auditable, enforcing community rules.

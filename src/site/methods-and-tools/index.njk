title: Methods and Tools
headerText: Methods & Tools
introductionBlurb: |
    **RxC tailors, deploys and supports transformative methodologies and tools to empower collaboration and consensus-building.**

    These approaches can be applied in diverse contexts to help counter polarization, overcome the tyranny of the majority, reshape the use and ownership of assets, and help communities make nuanced sets of choices when deciding on policy proposals, investments, budget allocations or crowd funding. 

    Inspired by the ideas of *Radical Markets* and our collaborations since 2018, RxC is fine-tuning the Plural Stack through experiments to help communities, associations and governments around the world supercharge participation. 

    We'd love to work with you to enhance your processes and unlock the ideas, passions and perspectives of your community in service of shared visions.
methodsBlurb: |
    RxC promotes and stewards methodologies and tools for collaboration, supports communities of innovators, and stimulates radical imagination for transformative change.

    We deploy a range of tools developed within our community, including the Plural Stack:
votingBlurb: |
    [**Plural Voting**](/methods-and-tools/plural-voting) makes it easy for a community to set priorities from a list of potential choices.
fundingBlurb: |
    [**Plural Funding**](/methods-and-tools/plural-funding) enables more democratic and scalable allocation of funds for public benefit.
ownershipBlurb: |
    [**Plural Ownership**](/methods-and-tools/plural-ownership) maximises productive uses of assets by making rights more fluid.
moneyBlurb: |
    [**Plural Money**](/methods-and-tools/plural-money) incentivizes value-creation and circulation within communities.

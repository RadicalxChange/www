  **A Global Conversation on Democratic Resilience & Frontline Innovation**

  Amid ongoing conflict, Ukraine is demonstrating extraordinary global leadership in delivering frontline innovation in decentralized governance and digital platforms for democratic participation. Their work offers the world an opportunity to learn from Ukraine as they democratize and decentralize from the bottom up, with urgent relevance far beyond their borders.

  Around the world, the gap between democratic ideals and democratic reality has never been more visible or more dangerous. Trust in parliaments has declined by nine percentage points globally since 1990, with 36 democracies experiencing erosion of confidence. Yet support for democratic ideals remains high. From Nepal to the Philippines, Indonesia to Brazil, a generation is taking to the streets not to reject democracy, but to demand it actually work.

  **Join us for a three-hour global conversation bringing together innovators from Ukraine, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, and Scotland** as we explore how transformative approaches to digital democracy can renew trust, expand participation, and build resilience in contexts of crisis and conflict.

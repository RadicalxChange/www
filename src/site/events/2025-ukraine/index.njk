  **A Global Conversation on Democratic Resilience & Frontline Innovation**

  Amid ongoing conflict, Ukraine is demonstrating extraordinary global leadership in delivering frontline innovation in decentralized governance and digital platforms for democratic participation. Their work offers the world an opportunity to learn from Ukraine as they democratize and decentralize from the bottom up, with urgent relevance far beyond their borders.

  Around the world, the gap between democratic ideals and democratic reality has never been more visible or more dangerous. Trust in parliaments has declined by nine percentage points globally since 1990, with 36 democracies experiencing erosion of confidence. Yet support for democratic ideals remains high. From Nepal to the Philippines, Indonesia to Brazil, a generation is taking to the streets not to reject democracy, but to demand it actually work.

  **Join us for a three-hour global conversation bringing together innovators from Ukraine, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, and Scotland** as we explore how transformative approaches to digital democracy can renew trust, expand participation, and build resilience in contexts of crisis and conflict.

Tang’s government involvement began in 2014 after she broadcast the Sunflower Movement’s demands and mediated conflicts during the activists’ occupation of Taiwan’s Legislature. Tang also played a role in shaping Taiwan’s gov-zero, or g0v, a grassroots movement promoting transparency and civic engagement. Tang worked in open-source software, where she revitalized the Haskell and Perl programming languages. Tang was named in 2023 to TIME’s 100 Most Influential People in AI list.

  - **Katia Lukicheva** is a strategic advisor on financing and systems innovation for global public goods, and the founder of Decoland, a policy and systems design lab advancing new architectures for public purpose finance and civic resilience. With two decades of experience across philanthropy, international financing institutions, and civic movements shaping fiscal policy and democratic governance reforms, her work examines innovative approaches to building more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable financing systems for the common good and the role emerging technologies can play in enabling them. She also leads CivicChain, a cross-sector initiative supporting civil society and other actors to engage with frontier technologies and emerging Web3 ecosystems to co-create new models of financing, collaboration, and governance through strategic learning, capacity building, and pilot development. Her current work explores how these innovations can renew the social contract between states, markets, and citizens, and reimagine the global development system for a more resilient and inclusive future.

Both ventures focused on transforming social systems through digital technology. In 2024, he ran for Governor of Tokyo on a platform centered on digital democracy, receiving over 150,000 votes. In January 2025, he launched Digital Democracy 2030, and in May founded the political party Team Mirai. He was elected to the House of Councillors (proportional representation) in the same year, achieving the threshold for official party status with over 2% of the national vote.

## Introduction

Independent community chapters of the RadicalxChange (“RxC”) movement are emerging to develop knowledge, experimentation, inclusion, and expertise for change.

RadicalxChange chapters are independent of RadicalxChange Foundation, and are responsible for their own activities and actions. Nonetheless, they aspire to share a broad set of ideals, and to behave according to high standards of decency and respect.

The Guidelines and Code of Conduct may change or be updated from time to time. Chapter organizers should regularly re-acquaint themselves with these documents.

## RxC Values

**Openness**: RadicalxChange is open. It seeks to facilitate a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.

**Egalitarianism**: Many of the ideas at RadicalxChange are animated by a belief that hyper-concentrations of wealth and power are neither inevitable nor efficient, and that a more genuinely open and competitive system would result in a broader and more just distribution of wealth and power.

**Dignity**: Every person’s well-being (financial and otherwise) is a good in itself. We want our work to reflect and express this.

**Social Innovation**: At RadicalxChange we embrace the challenge of overturning stale categories and assumptions! We believe that thoughtful, collaborative innovation can help build better social institutions. We also believe that technological change can generate distortions when not accompanied by social innovation, so that a technologically-changing society has a standing obligation to reexamine and reinvent its social institutions.

## Governance Principles

**Diversity**: To build a truly broad-based and effective community, we incorporate the insights and perspectives of a wide range of social interests, political backgrounds, identity groups and vocational expertise. RadicalxChange leaders strive to actively include people who differ from them.

**Decentralization**: RadicalxChange is anti-authoritarian in outlook and seeks to be the change it wishes to promote. Leaders at all levels of RadicalxChange strive to push decision-making authority outward to the extent possible, recognizing the substantial informal authority they hold as leaders and seeking primarily to include and draw upon members of the community wherever possible rather than aggregating decision- making authority in their own hands.

**Responsibility**: RadicalxChange leaders are chosen for their expertise in their respective areas of responsibility. They take responsibility for ensuring engagement, quality decision-making, and fair representation of their domain externally and the consistency of internal participation and governance aligned with other RadicalxChange principles.

**Social Justice Mission**: RadicalxChange is primarily devoted to achieving its overarching social justice mission, rather than achieving the private goals of any member. RadicalxChange should not become a source of personal enrichment for any individual to the exclusion of the community.

**Respect**: RadicalxChange community members treat each other as epistemic and social equals. Harassment will not be tolerated. Community members should aim to empathize with the intellectual and personal perspective each member of the community brings to the table.

## Legal Relationship

**Independent**: RadicalxChange chapters are independent groups, not subsidiaries, representatives, or agents of the RadicalxChange Foundation. Chapters, organizers, and participants, must not represent themselves to anyone as representatives of the RadicalxChange Foundation. The RadicalxChange Foundation does not have control over or responsibility for the content, speakers, sponsors, organization or execution of RadicalxChange chapter events. As a chapter or chapter organizer, it is your responsibility to make third parties aware of this distinction wherever ambiguity may arise.

**Communication Regarding Large-Scale Events**: To the extent chapter organizers wish to have the RadicalxChange Foundation endorse any large-scale events (larger than 50 attendees), or high-budget events or activities (more than \$5,000), such chapter organizers must communicate with the RadicalxChange Foundation early in their planning process to ensure message consistency and adherence to these Guidelines and the Code of Conduct.

RadicalxChange Foundation reserves the right to withdraw permission to use the names RadicalxChange, RadXChange, RxC, or similar. RadicalxChange Foundation will withdraw permission to use these names from anyone who does not act in accordance with this Code of Conduct.

## Becoming an Official Chapter or Organizer

**Chapters**: Chapters should register the names of their chapters with RadicalxChange Foundation, and communicate to RadicalxChange Foundation the names of responsible organizers. Chapter organizers will be contacted by RadicalxChange Foundation if there are complaints about events or actions associated with that chapter.

## Inclusivity

The RadicalxChange movement seeks to be radically inclusive. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, and religion.This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.We invite all those who participate in the RadicalxChange movement to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Non-Partisan

The RadicalxChange movement is non-partisan. That doesn’t mean we don’t talk politics; but we seek to strive to find new modes of collaboration and common ground. Chapters are asked not to endorse parties or campaign for candidates.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Make a concerted effort to be respectful, kind, welcoming, helpful, non-partisan, and open to others.

## Weapons Policy

No weapons may be allowed at RadicalxChange community events, spaces, etc.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. RadicalxChange Foundation or chapter leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, including an immediate temporary or permanent ban from community events, or a revocation of permission to associate yourself or your organization with the RadicalxChange movement.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a chapter leader or RadicalxChange Foundation as soon as possible. >> info@radicalxchange.org

Additionally, RadicalxChange chapter organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers should make it their top priority to provide escort or other assistance as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

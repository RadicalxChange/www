## Short description of the proposal or policy framework

"The Handbook for Radical Local Democracy" is a toolkit designed for local policymakers and engaged citizens. It introduces innovative policy mechanisms to address pressing urban challenges. The framework is built on three core proposals:

- **Plural Voting (PV):** A voting system that allows participants to express the intensity of their preferences on various issues, leading to more nuanced and representative outcomes.
- **Plural Funding (PF):** A mechanism for funding public goods that amplifies the contributions of a broad base of supporters, ensuring that projects with widespread community backing receive more funding.
- **Plural Ownership/Self-Assessed Licenses Sold via Auction (SALSA):** A system for managing and pricing public assets and licenses where individuals self-assess the value of an asset and must be willing to sell it to anyone at that price.

## What problem did this project seek to address?

The handbook seeks to address the issue of excessive concentrations of power, both in the public and private sectors, which can stifle democracy and create market distortions. Informed by leading research in economic incentive design, it offers solutions for a range of urban problems, including:

- Ineffective **citizen engagement** and voting systems that fail to capture the true preferences of the community.
- The underfunding of **public goods** due to the "free-rider" problem.
- The inefficient and inequitable allocation of **public assets**, such as commercial land and licenses.

## How does this support more democratic outcomes?

This framework supports more democratic outcomes in several key ways:

- **Plural Voting (PV)** protects the interests of minority groups by allowing them to focus their voice on the issues that matter most to them, preventing a "tyranny of the majority." This leads to more equitable and less polarized decision-making.
- **Plural Funding (PF)** democratizes the funding of public projects by giving more weight to the number of individual supporters rather than the total amount of money contributed. This ensures that projects with broad community support are prioritized.
- **Plural Ownership/SALSA** ensures that public assets are used efficiently and that the public reaps the benefits of their value. It prevents private interests from monopolizing these assets and promotes a more equitable distribution of resources.

## Who are the key audiences or communities of participants?

The primary audiences for this framework are **local policymakers**, **city officials**, and **engaged citizens** who are looking for innovative solutions to urban problems. Other key communities of participants include urban planners, community organizers, and anyone interested in improving local governance and democratic processes.

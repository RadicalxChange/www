## Short description of the proposal or policy framework

This policy framework proposes ways to move from plutocratic, wealth-based governance models in blockchain communities toward more democratic and plural systems. The framework, using the Wildland project as a case study, is built on two core pillars:

- **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs):** Governance rights are tied to a user's engagement and social relationships within the network, measured through non-transferable tokens that represent a user's affiliations, memberships, and credentials.
- **Plural Mechanisms:** The use of Plural Voting and Plural Funding allow participants to express the intensity of their preferences, protect minority interests, and encourage diverse coalitions.

## What problem did this project seek to address?

The framework confronts the trend of re-centralization of power in web3. Many blockchain projects, despite their decentralized architecture, default to governance systems where power is proportional to wealth, such as one-token-one-vote, leading to plutocracy. This framework seeks to address the following specific problems:

- The dominance of "coin-voting," which often leads to governance outcomes that favor large token holders over the broader community of users and builders.
- A lack of genuine political decentralization to match the architectural decentralization of the technology.
- Vulnerability to Sybil attacks, where a single actor can create multiple fake identities to gain disproportionate influence.

## Was this developed in partnership with any organization or in response to a call for submissions, etc?

This framework was developed with the support of the Golem Foundation and focuses on the Golem-led project, Wildland.

## How does this support more democratic outcomes?

This framework redefines what constitutes a "stakeholder" in a digital community. By shifting from a purely financial basis of power to one based on social reputation, accounting for different types of contributions and relationships, it empowers a broader and more diverse set of community members. And by creating a system where identity and reputation are harder to fake, the framework offers stronger protections against collusion and Sybil attacks, leading to more legitimate and trustworthy governance processes.

## Who are the key audiences or communities of participants?

The primary audiences for this framework are entities and individuals involved in building and participating in decentralized digital ecosystems. This includes:

- Blockchain developers and platform builders who are designing governance systems for DAOs, dApps, and other web3 projects.
- Users of decentralized technologies who are seeking more agency and a greater voice in the platforms they use.
- Researchers, policymakers, and advocates in the fields of digital governance, decentralized systems, and democratic innovation.

## Were there any related events, outcomes or impacts?

The "Finding Wildland's Soul" report published in 2022 is the central outcome of this work. The report is intended to serve as a roadmap to guide the Wildland community in implementing Plurality principles.

## Are there any testimonials, documents, assets, links or other ways we can illustrate this project?

## Short description of the project

This was the first time a public official in the US used Plural Voting (PV) in a process open to their whole constituency. New York City Council member Kristin Richardson Jordan, with support from RadicalxChange, used PV to conduct a participatory budgeting poll in which voters allocated a $1M capital budget across competing project proposals. Registration was verified against voter rolls and by mailed authentication letters and QR codes.

## What problem did this project seek to address?

Traditional participatory budgeting processes often struggle with limited accessibility and turnout, while online platforms raise concerns about identity verification, voter eligibility, and resistance to manipulation. The pilot aimed to test whether an open, online Plural Voting process could be conducted securely and with integrity for an entire constituency.

## Who were the key audiences or communities of participants?

Residents of New York City Council District 9.

## How does this support more democratic outcomes?

The NYC pilot strengthened democratic outcomes by combining accessibility with security. The online PV system extended participation beyond traditional in-person meetings, allowing a broader and more diverse cross-section of Harlem residents to have their voices heard. At the same time, robust identity verification through Secure Internet Voting ensured that every ballot was linked to an eligible resident, protecting against duplication and fraud. This created a transparent, trustworthy process where participants could confidently express the intensity of their preferences and trust that the results accurately reflected the community’s priorities.

## How did RxC add value/support this experiment?

RxC designed and adapted the PV interface and process, documented project goals and results, helped integrate the method into the participatory budgeting workflow, and partnered with SIV to operationalize identity verification and mailing authentication—producing a low-overhead, replicable pilot that other public officials can follow.

## What were the outcomes or impacts?

- The pilot allocated its full budget of $1M to the most popular project, The Baxter, funding the development of 150-175 new affordable housing units in Harlem over the next five years.
- Participants who voted reported an 80% satisfaction rate with the voting process. Around 18% of participants did not utilize their entire PV budget, indicating a need for further voter education.

## Are there any testimonials, documents, assets, links or other ways we can illustrate this project?

“It was an honor to work with RadicalxChange to make the budget process in our district more democratic and more transparent. This process has opened the door to participation for parents, workers, students, and others who for whatever reason cannot be in a room physically and make their voice heard. This was a fantastic pilot program, and I hope other Councilmembers work with RadicalxChange to make Participatory Budgeting even more participatory.” — Councilmember Kristin Richardson Jordan

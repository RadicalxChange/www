## Short description of the proposal or policy framework

This proposal advocates for the adoption of Participation Officer (PO) Networks, a kind of training program that embeds specially selected, tech-savvy public servants within various government agencies and teams. Their core mission is to act as network connectors, fostering collaboration between agencies and facilitating meaningful public participation in the policymaking process. Using a suite of digital tools, POs bridge the gap between government and civil society, ensuring that citizen voices are heard and integrated into governance.

## What problem did this project seek to address?

Participation Officers address the growing disconnect between governments and their citizens, often referred to as the "missing half of open government." While many governments have embraced data transparency and "open data", they have been slow to create effective channels for public participation and dialogue. This leads to a breakdown in public trust, bureaucratic inertia, and policies that are unresponsive to public needs. PO Networks directly tackle issues of departmental silos, political polarization, and the slow pace of traditional governance in a rapidly changing digital world.

## Was this developed in partnership with any organization or in response to a call for submissions, etc?

The foundational model for Participation Officer Networks was developed organically within the Taiwanese government. It was largely a response to the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement, a citizen protest that highlighted deep public frustration with the lack of government transparency. Spearheaded by Digital Minister Audrey Tang and Taiwan’s Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS), the network was an internal government innovation designed to rebuild trust and create a more collaborative form of governance.

## How does this support more democratic outcomes?

PO Networks create the infrastructure for **digital participation**. It moves beyond simple consultation to active collaboration:

- **Scales Deliberation:** It utilizes digital platforms to facilitate large-scale conversations, allowing tens of thousands of citizens to participate and find consensus on contentious issues without devolving into divisive debate.
- **Breaks Down Silos:** POs work across teams and functions, ensuring that policy is developed holistically rather than in isolation. This inter-agency collaboration makes government more efficient and effective.
- **Increases Legitimacy and Trust:** By giving citizens a direct and consequential role in shaping policy, the government gains public trust and legitimacy. Policies are more resilient because they are built on a foundation of broad consensus.

## Who are the key audiences or communities of participants?

PO networks involve a wide range of participants:

- **Participation Officers:** The core group of public servants who facilitate the process.
- **Public Servants:** Colleagues within the government who learn to collaborate with the public.
- **General Public:** Any citizen who wishes to contribute their opinion and experience to the policymaking process.

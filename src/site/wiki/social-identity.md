Whereas most existing identity concepts are either centralized (with a small number of large, institutional credential providers), or individualistic (with self-authentication), Social Identity solutions are aimed at expanding the scope of possible credential verifiers to include a wider variety of authenticators. To that end it can use non-transferable markers of affiliations, memberships, or credentials, such as [Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) — which are a bit like NFTs, except that they are not bought, sold, or traded; or [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential), a tamper-evident credential using cryptography to authenticate its authorship. In doing so, Social Identity better embodies human identities’ social, and multi-dimensional characteristics.

Social Identity solutions are new and the possibilities are still emerging. But they are likely to become an important tool for establishing digital identity and defining community, unlocking important new governance structures. To name a few:

- establishing the reliability of information sources in an era of deep fakes

- permissioning access to communities’ shared assets, including data

- making DAOs less plutocratic by anchoring governance power in community participation

- [improving plural funding](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-soulbound-tokens-can-make-gitcoin-grants-more-pluralistic/10077?u=leone) by serving as a privacy-preserving, hard-to-fake evidence of group membership

These are still early days for XIDs, and we are excited to help steer them in a productive direction.

[BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) - BrightID is a social identity network that allows people to prove to applications that they aren’t using multiple accounts. It solves the unique identity problem through the creation and analysis of a social graph.

[Equality Protocol / Democracy Earth](https://democracy.earth/) - Equality Protocol is a probabilistic score for human identity on Ethereum. The score results from a subjective (deliberative process) and an objective (Gini coefficients) input. Certain scores give you the right to participate in e.g. universal basic incomes or elections.

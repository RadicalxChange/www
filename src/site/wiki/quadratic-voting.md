Quadratic Voting (QV) is a redesigned voting method reflecting the intensity of people’s preferences in collective decisions. It greatly mitigates tyranny-of-the-majority and factional control problems.

Voters receive budgets of “voice credits,” which they allocate to different questions on the ballot to signal the intensity of their conviction. Their voice credits convert to “counted votes” according to their square root. So if you put one voice credit on an issue, that is one vote; four credits are two votes; nine credits are three votes, and so on.

## Use cases

### Prioritization, Roadmapping, and Budgeting

Quadratic Voting is a great tool for prioritizing proposals that draw from a common, finite resource. For example, if a group needs to decide on how to allocate a fixed budget across a set of proposed projects, QV provides a way to batch all the proposals onto a single ballot and efficiently gather rich data about which proposals the group cares about the most.

QV also shines in situations where the proposals draw on the group’s resources in ways that are harder to quantify. Sometimes the group needs to decide between different ways they can allocate their limited time and energy, such as in a product roadmap or a meeting agenda.

### Polling and market research

Polling and market research represents another nuanced and powerful use case for QV. In a survey or opinion poll, individual respondents are battling for the attention of the group. Therefore, respondents are incentivized to “shout,” or express strong views.

Consider the widely used Likert survey format, in which respondents are asked to express how they feel about various issues on a scale of “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” In Likert surveys, responses tend to cluster to the extremes. As a result, these surveys tend to misrepresent the preferences of the group and magnify polarization.

Quadratic Voting gives everyone equal power to direct the attention of the group toward an issue they care about, but forces them to do so at the cost of their influence on other issues. In other words, individuals have a fixed amount of “voice”—and shouting about an issue will leave one with significantly less voice to use on other issues.

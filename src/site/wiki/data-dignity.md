Technology companies wield highly concentrated power over the way peoples’ data is used, and make enormous profits from it. They can do this because we “bargain” for Big Tech services as if we were all isolated individuals, with “personal” datasets. In fact, the data we produce is always deeply social. Sharing it affects our friends, families, and communities as much as it affects us.

People should be able to exert democratic collective bargaining power over their data, in order to make joint decisions controlling its use, and negotiate appropriate compensation.

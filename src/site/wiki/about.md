The best opportunities for liberating social progress arise in times of technological transformation. Yet technologies that emerge from capitalist incentives too often fail to deliver on this promise. More often, they increase our capacity to pursue self-interest and externalize harm, exacerbating our deepest challenges rather than solving them. 

So we need to look elsewhere – beyond capitalism and other conventional wisdom – to find real progress and deliver on technology’s true potential. We need better techniques for cooperating across difference: integrating our interests with others, making decisions together, and accepting the legitimacy of compromises. 

RadicalxChange focuses on the details of how to do this, with particular attention to institutional innovation:

  - **Research:** We support and contribute to rigorous research and development of novel decision-making and power-sharing systems, such as [quadratic voting](/wiki/quadratic-voting/) & [funding](/wiki/plural-funding/), [common ownership structures](/wiki/partial-common-ownership/), [plural currencies](/wiki/plural-money/), [social identity](/wiki/social-identity/), and “listening-at-scale” citizen engagement techniques.

  - **Prototypes:** We develop open-source technologies, such as our [quadratic voting tool](https://demo.quadraticvote.radicalxchange.org/), [RxC Voice](https://voice.radicalxchange.org/), and [PCOArt](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/), that enable dynamic experimentation and illustrate promising new directions in institutional design.

  - **Partnerships:** We work hand-in-hand with a wide variety of institutions, ranging from [governments](/wiki/colorado-qv/) to [arts institutions](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/) to [data unions](/wiki/data-dignity/) and [web3 networks](/updates/blog/finding-wildlands-soul/), to facilitate careful real-world implementations of boundary-pushing systems.

  - **Movement-Building:** We [educate the public](/updates/) and [host events](/events/) to weave surprising coalitions that can help grow the movement for plural innovation and democratic revitalization.

RadicalxChange Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to democratic innovation and institutional design through operational partnerships and experimental projects between academia, government, art, technology, and beyond.

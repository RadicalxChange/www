Partial Common Ownership (also known as PCO, Plural Property, COST, or SALSA) is a new way of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.

In Partial Common Ownership systems, assets belong to no one and everyone. An asset’s current possessor must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend.  If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.

A group of Web3 technologists has come together to form an independent RadicalxChange chapter focused on bringing Partial Common Ownership Tokens to Ethereum.  Learn more on our [website](https://partialcommonownership.com) or join the conversation in our active [Discord](https://discord.gg/CjxV954JMT).

In addition, RadicalxChange Foundation is collaborating with Serpentine Arts Technologies and a team of Partial Common Ownership builders to [introduce partial common ownership](/wiki/pco-art) to the culture and practice of artists and collectors. We are building infrastructure for the management of partial common ownership interests and helping artists experiment with this new concept for the stewardship of their work.

[Geo Web](https://geoweb.land/) - Geo Web is a set of open protocols for anchoring digital content (e.g., augmented reality, NFTs, apps, games, etc.) to physical locations. It uses partial common ownership to administer its global digital land market with all proceeds being used to fund public goods. The network runs on the Optimism L2 Rollup.

[Eden Network](https://www.edennetwork.io/) - Eden is a priority transaction network that protects traders from frontrunning, aligns incentives for block producers, and redistributes miner extractable value by allocating Ethereum blockspace with Harberger taxation.

[Harberger Ads](https://hads.xyz/) - Harberger Ads is an advertising marketplace governed by the rules of SALSA. Bootstrapped in a hackathon, the application allows you to sell ad space on your site or to possess other people's ad spaces. In its current version, Harberger Ads runs on Ethereum's test network.

[Nonomos](https://nonomos.com/) - Nonomos is a pilot application on Ethereum’s Rinkeby test network that by means of SALSA, governs the rights to cast YouTube videos on the associated site nonomos.com. Beyond that, it lets you mint and interact with additional unique tokens that work like SALSA.

[Wildcards](https://wildcards.world/) - Wildcards applies gamification of market powers to fundraising for animal conservation. The "Wildcards" are tokens à la SALSA, which income goes to conservation foundations. The possessors of the tokens, or guardians of the animals, compare their contributions on a leaderboard.

[This Artwork Is Always On Sale](https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com/) - TAIAOS is a unique, rare digital artwork that is always on sale along the economic lines of SALSA.

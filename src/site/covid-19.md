The RadicalxChange Foundation is an institutional affiliate and supporter of the [Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience](https://www.pandemictesting.org/), the latest report issued by the Edmond J. Safra Center For Ethics from Harvard University, on ending the quarantine via Testing, Tracing & Supported Isolation (#TTSI).

> “Our bipartisan group of experts in economics, public health, technology, and ethics from across the country, with support from [The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/), has released the nation’s first comprehensive operational roadmap for mobilizing and reopening the U.S. economy in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis “[Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience: Massive Scale Testing, Tracing, and Supported Isolation (TTSI) as the Path to Pandemic Resilience for a Free Society](https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/roadmaptopandemicresilience_updated_4.20.20.pdf),” lays out how a massive scale-up of testing, paired with contact tracing and supported isolation, can rebuild trust in our personal safety and re-mobilize the U.S. economy. Among the report’s top recommendations is the need to deliver at least 5 million tests per day by early June to help ensure a safe social opening. This number will need to increase to 20 million tests per day by mid-summer to fully re-mobilize the economy.”

## Why RadicalxChange is supporting key COVID-19 response initiatives?

COVID-19 threatens countless lives, as well as the social fabric upon which hopes for a better future depend. Therefore we are proud to be associated with the Safra Center’s efforts to build an effective resilient response while upholding fundamental values and civil liberties.

Minimizing harm from the pandemic requires setting aside minor differences and pulling together. Accordingly, the group that worked on this roadmap is ideologically diverse but shares an awareness of the urgency of the problem and a commitment to do the sensible thing.

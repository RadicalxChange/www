    title: "Exploring Social Technologies for Democracy",
    speakers: "Kaliya Young, Heidi Nobantu Saul, Tom Atlee, Jennifer Morone",
    description: `Exploring social technologies & their role in fostering democracy with Kaliya Young, Heidi Nobantu Saul & Tom Atlee, moderated by Jennifer Morone.

We see democracy as ideally a process of co-creating the conditions of our shared lives, solving our collective problems, and learning about life from and with each other. The less force and the more creativity, aliveness, and intelligence we can bring to this process, the better. This requires a lot of communication and conversation to share information, ideas, experiences, needs, values, energy and so much more - in ways that actually work.

Many different approaches to doing this sharing and talking have been created. When such ways are formalized as methods that can be applied and taught, we call them “technologies”. Most of the social technologies for democracy we work with are grounded in conversation - discussion, dialogue, deliberation, choice-creating, negotiation, collective visioning, and various forms of council, assembly, conference, and so on. There are different dynamics and nuances among them, and there are experts trained to facilitate the theory and/or practice.

Democratic technologies, thought of and used in this way, can be applied in creative new ways that enable people to become more engaged with each other, with better results and less wasted, counter-productive energy, thus moving towards more successful, enjoyable self-governance. They operate at a variety of scales from small groups, organizations, and networks to whole societies.

    title: "Navigating Digital Identity in Political Economies",
    speakers: "Bryan Ford, Shireen Mitchell, Kaliya Young, Glen Weyl",
    description: `Most digital identity systems are centralized (e.g., in big government or technology organizations) or individualistic (e.g., in most blockchain projects). However, being in the world is fundamentally social and intersectional — we are all part of networks. So how might we formalize digital identity in a way that better reflects this complex reality? This panel with leading social technology and computer researchers explores more robust digital identity approaches and potential application areas in political economies.

    title: "RxC Voice: From Election Insights to Action",
    speakers: "Jennifer Morone, Matt Prewitt, Alex Randaccio",
    description: `In keeping with our goal and promise to make the RadicalxChange Foundation democratically governed and accountable, the RxC team built a new participatory governance application called RxC Voice, combining liquid democracy, online deliberation, and quadratic voting. Having just concluded the first instance of this large-scale collective decision pilot, here are the results for the question posed: ‘What activities should the RadicalxChange Foundation prioritize in 2021-2022?’

The experiment ran from May 17th to June 8th, 2021 and was structured in three foundational stages: (1) Delegation, (2) Deliberation, and (3) Election. Prior to the event, the RxC Foundation team put out an open call inviting members of the community to take part in the pilot. Out of around 150 who requested to take part or were invited, 68 signed up and participated in the process by delegating voice credits to fellow representatives, engaging in a democratic conversation via Polis, ratifying the resulting ballot curated by RxC Foundation, and prioritizing the ballot’s 54 proposals in a quadratic vote. In the end the democratic process ran smoothly and resulted in actionable and valuable takeaways.

    title: "RadicalxChange Voice: An Introduction",
    speakers: "Jennifer Lyn Morone, Matt Prewitt, Alex Randaccio",
    description: `RadicalxChange Voice is a new governance tool and experiment to bring in the RxC community to guide RxC Foundation's work. Hopefully, if the experiment turns out well, we can help other communities adopt it to enable a broader range of democratic participation. It also features some new thinking about QF, Pol.is, and QV. As we get ready to try it out, the Foundation's team introduces you to RxC Voice's end-to-end democratic process and explains the thinking behind it. Most importantly, it is your opportunity to ask us anything about it.
